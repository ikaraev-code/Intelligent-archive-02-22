Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare

AI is transforming healthcare by enabling faster diagnosis, personalized treatment plans, and drug discovery. Machine learning algorithms can analyze medical images with accuracy comparable to expert radiologists. Natural language processing helps extract insights from clinical notes and research papers. 

Key applications include:
1. Medical imaging analysis for early cancer detection
2. Predictive analytics for patient outcomes
3. Drug discovery and development acceleration
4. Virtual health assistants for patient engagement
5. Genomic analysis for personalized medicine

The global AI in healthcare market is expected to reach $45.2 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 44.9%. Challenges include data privacy, regulatory compliance, and the need for explainable AI models.
