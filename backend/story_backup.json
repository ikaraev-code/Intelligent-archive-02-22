          "content": "### Chapter \u2014 1981: The First PC (Final)\n\nI came to the United States in May of 1980. By then I was working at Golding Industries\u2014my second job in America\u2014doing software development for a textile manufacturing company. The computer I lived inside every day was an IBM mainframe running CICS, an online transaction system that handled everything the business did in real time.\n\nOne task in particular stayed with me.\n\nGolding had a manufacturing plant in South Carolina, and they needed invoices printed there\u2014remotely\u2014without someone manually handling tapes or paper in New York. Today that sounds ordinary. Back then it wasn\u2019t. The system didn\u2019t really \u201csupport\u201d programming a remote printer the way you\u2019d expect. So I did what you did in those days: I went down to the metal. I wrote a utility at the machine-code level and made it work.\n\nI was proud of it. But I also couldn\u2019t forget how hard it had been just to do something so basic\u2014send words to paper.\n\nEven before I left the USSR, I\u2019d heard rumors of a new kind of technology while listening to Voice of America: *personal computers.* Small enough to sit on a desk. Affordable enough\u2014supposedly\u2014that a person could own one. The idea lodged in my head like a splinter: a real computer that belonged to you.\n\nBy the fall of 1981 my wife and I had been working for close to a year. We weren\u2019t making much by American standards, but we had something we hadn\u2019t had before: stability. We lived in a rented apartment in Brooklyn with almost no furniture\u2014just necessities. But compared to what we\u2019d left behind, it felt like freedom.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I remembered my promise to myself: I was going to get a PC.\n\nThe popular machines then were the Apple II and the TRS-80. IBM had announced its PC, but nobody yet knew it would become *the* standard. I chose it anyway. I was working on IBM systems every day, and I believed\u2014almost instinctively\u2014in IBM\u2019s gravity. If I was going to buy a computer with my own money, it had to be an IBM PC.\n\nThe problem was the price.\n\nMy system had 64KB of memory. For storage it had two floppy drives, 320KB each. And a dot-matrix printer that\u2014if I remember correctly\u2014printed at about 10 characters per second. By today\u2019s standards it\u2019s almost comical. The Mac I\u2019m writing this story on has 32GB of memory\u201432,000,000,000 bytes compared to 64,000.\n\nBut in 1981 it was a full-blown computer. A programmable machine. A world.\n\nThe cost was over $5,000 at the IBM retail store when they opened in New York\u2014over $14,000 in today\u2019s money. My annual salary was around $24,000. I had been in the country barely a year. We had no real savings. Still, I was determined.\n\nSo I went to a bank for a personal loan.\n\nThey said no\u2014at least, not without a guarantor. My credit history was too short. If someone with strong credit co-signed, they would do it.\n\nI asked a man named Mody Zeidman.\n\nMody lived in our neighborhood. He volunteered as an English teacher at our synagogue. He was a lawyer\u2014a native New Yorker\u2014with everything I didn\u2019t yet have: a long history in this country, a stable reputation, and the kind of confidence that comes with belonging. At the time I didn\u2019t fully understand what I was asking. In my mind it was just paperwork.\n\nIn America, it was trust.\n\nMody agreed without hesitation.\n\nWith Mody\u2019s signature, the bank gave me a $6,000 loan. I went to the IBM store and brought home my computer. I still remember setting it up on the only table we owned.\n\n(There\u2019s a photo from that day. I\u2019m half naked because it was summer, hot, and we didn\u2019t have an air conditioner yet. But we had a computer.)\n\nOnce everything was connected and powered up, I started to learn the machine the way I always learned machines: by taking it apart with code.\n\nThe software was primitive. There wasn\u2019t even a real text editor\u2014just a line editor. You edited one line at a time. For programming you had BASIC and, if you were brave, assembler for Intel\u2019s 8088.\n\nI decided my first project would be a full-screen text editor, like the one I used on the IBM mainframe at work.\n\nIt was harder than I expected. But while building it I realized something that would later become the heart of everything: if I controlled the screen and the keyboard mapping, I didn\u2019t have to stop at English. With some creativity, I could make it write in Russian\u2014or any alphabet I understood. And I could make it go not only left to right, but right to left.\n\nMy best friend, Gera Ginzburg, was living in Israel then. He had left the USSR almost a year before me. When I told him what I was building, he immediately said: \u201cMake it support Hebrew. Make it write right to left.\u201d\n\nHe was right. And once the idea was spoken out loud, there was no going back.\n\nI brought in Gera in Israel and Igor Saxonov in Brooklyn\u2014someone I\u2019d been introduced to\u2014and the three of us worked nights. We kept pushing the editor until it became something bigger: a multilingual word processor.\n\nWithin a year, we had a product that felt unusual for the early IBM PC market.\n\nAnd then we hit a new problem.\n\nWe had built it.\n\nBut we had absolutely no idea what to do with it. In the USSR we didn\u2019t know how to start a business. In America, we were about to find out\u2014fast.\n\n---\n\n### Early Days of Marketing a PC Product\n\nOnce we had a multilingual word processor that actually worked, we ran straight into a problem that had nothing to do with software.\n\nWe didn\u2019t know how to sell it.\n\nOf the three of us, Igor was the most entrepreneurial. He didn\u2019t have a \u201cnetwork\u201d in the American sense of the word\u2014none of us did\u2014but he had initiative and a kind of fearless curiosity. He started calling people, asking questions, turning small connections into meetings. Friends of friends. Acquaintances from the neighborhood. Anyone who might know someone who owned a computer store or knew a businessman who was \u201cin computers.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how we began to get introduced to the early PC world in Brooklyn\u2014small storefronts, cramped back offices, people learning the business as they went along. We\u2019d bring disks, do demonstrations, talk too much, and listen carefully. Sometimes we were taken seriously. Sometimes we weren\u2019t. Sometimes we were sure we were in the middle of a real business conversation, only to realize later that we were speaking different languages\u2014not Russian and English, but \u201cengineering\u201d and \u201csales.\u201d\n\nThrough this meager chain of introductions, we eventually found our way to the Want brothers and their store in downtown Brooklyn. In those days, a computer store wasn\u2019t a sleek showroom\u2014it was more like a workshop with a cash register. Boxes stacked to the ceiling, machines in various states of assembly, printers chattering in the background, customers asking basic questions that today would seem unbelievable. The Want brothers were practical people. They understood customers. They understood what sold. And they understood immediately that what we had\u2014especially the ability to handle multiple alphabets, and right-to-left\u2014wasn\u2019t just a technical trick. For the right buyer, it was a market.\n\nOne introduction led to another. Without going into some details that were, in hindsight, almost hilarious, we stumbled into a man who decided he would build a software company around our product.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t a programmer. He wasn\u2019t even from the PC world. He was a sophisticated businessman\u2014a commodities trader\u2014who saw the opportunity before he understood the mechanics. And he was about to learn, the hard way, that early PC software wasn\u2019t like commodities. You couldn\u2019t treat it as a thing you bought and sold and expected to behave by itself. It needed engineering. It needed support. It needed constant improvement.\n\nBut in one crucial respect, he was serious: he wanted to buy the product outright.\n\n---\n\n### Selling the Product \u2014 \u201cLock, Stock and Barrel\u201d\n\nBy then, Mody Zeidman had become more than the man who co-signed my bank loan. He was the one American in our orbit who could translate this new world for us: contracts, leverage, negotiation, the quiet power of simply knowing how business is done here.\n\nMody helped us negotiate and represented us through what became a surprisingly convoluted, protracted process. There were terms, conditions, drafts, revisions, and the kind of back-and-forth that feels less like logic and more like endurance\u2014especially when you\u2019re new to the country and still learning how to read between the lines.\n\nIn the end we agreed on a deal that, even now, still feels unreal when I say it out loud.\n\nThe buyer formed a company specifically for our product and purchased it\u2014and all rights to it\u2014*lock, stock and barrel* for **$600,000**.\n\nOnly because of Mody\u2019s help did we get what I believe was a very strong price for that time. We signed the papers and walked away from our creation somewhat stunned by the size of the number. For three recent emigrants who had started from scratch, it didn\u2019t just feel like a business transaction. It felt like proof that we could build something valuable in America.\n\nTo close the loop on the word processor: the new company and product were named **World Master**. Apparently, it eventually went public\u2014I suspect on the AIM market, but I\u2019m not sure. What I do know is that it never made the progress it could have, because it didn\u2019t have software engineering support. The man who bought it didn\u2019t engage us to keep developing it. Without the people who understood the code, the product couldn\u2019t evolve the way the market demanded. In time, the company folded.\n\nSo our first product didn\u2019t become a long-term commercial success.\n\nBut for us personally, it changed everything.\n\nWe were equal partners, and each of us walked away with **$200,000**. By then it was **January 1986**\u2014in today\u2019s value, that would be over **$560,000** each. A meaningful amount of money by any standard. For three recent emigrants, it felt enormous.\n\nWe felt rich. And in the USSR we didn\u2019t know how to start a business. In America, we were about to find out\u2014fast.",

          "content": "Here\u2019s a tightened, more narrative version of your \u201cMultex I / Goldman Sachs impetus\u201d section, keeping your voice but improving flow, clarity, and stakes. I\u2019ve also lightly corrected names/grammar (you can revert any detail to match your memory).\n\n---\n\n## Multex I \u2014 Goldman Sachs and the impetus\n\nNights belonged to my word processor. Days belonged to corporate America.\n\nEven after Golding Industries, I stayed on the \u201cday job\u201d track, but something had changed. Building that word processor had rewired my brain. I wasn\u2019t just learning how software worked\u2014I was learning how opportunity worked. And as PCs started creeping into serious corporate environments, I found myself pulled into advanced technology groups: the teams inside big companies whose job was to figure out what to do with this new, chaotic thing called the personal computer.\n\nBy January of 1986 I was at Goldman Sachs in IT, overseeing an R&D group focused on PC implementation across the firm. Goldman wasn\u2019t a place that experimented casually. Everything had to justify itself. But that was exactly what made it exciting: we were trying to take a tool that had been designed for individuals and force it to become something corporate\u2014secure, supportable, scalable, and useful to people who cared about speed and numbers.\n\nSomewhere in the middle of all that, the idea that I might start my own software business stopped feeling like a fantasy. It started feeling like an inevitability.\n\nThe opportunity arrived through a familiar voice from my past.\n\nMy old boss from Equitable Insurance\u2014Dolores Bailey\u2014reached out. She had moved into a role leading corporate R&D, focused on adopting and implementing new technology across Equitable, and she asked if I could help in a consulting capacity.\n\nI said yes immediately. Not just because it sounded interesting, but because I recognized what it really was: a door.\n\nConsulting meant I could do what I already knew how to do\u2014build\u2014and get paid for it, without asking anyone\u2019s permission. It was the cleanest bridge between \u201ccorporate employee\u201d and \u201centrepreneur\u201d that I could imagine.\n\n---\n\n## Founding Multex Systems (Multex I) and early clients\n\nIn April of 1986, I left Goldman and began consulting with Dolores\u2019s R&D group at Equitable. The work grew quickly\u2014enough that it didn\u2019t make sense to do it alone. I brought in three former Goldman colleagues: John Mahoney, George Baird, and Van Negris.\n\nTogether, we formed Multex Systems.\n\nI was the founding partner and majority shareholder, but the company was built as a true team effort from day one. We immediately started delivering multiple projects for Equitable\u2014practical PC and early Windows development work that big organizations wanted, but didn\u2019t yet have the internal muscle to execute consistently.\n\nI also gave Mody equity in Multex Systems. At the time it was partly appreciation for his role in the word processor sale, but it turned out to be more than that. Mody had a way of thinking about \u201cexit strategy\u201d before most people even admitted exits existed. When the time came again, that mindset proved important.\n\nAnd this is probably the best moment to explain the name: **Multex**.\n\nYears earlier, while naming the word processor, someone had tossed out an abbreviation for \u201cmultilingual text\u201d\u2014*mul-tex*. We never used it then, but it stuck in my head like a brand waiting for its product. When it came time to name the company, I pulled it off the shelf.\n\nMultex Systems\u2014Multex I\u2014was primarily a consulting firm: custom development projects for PC and Windows environments. Our first major clients were Equitable and Goldman\u2014both former employers\u2014where friends and colleagues pulled us back in for specific projects.\n\nThe company gradually grew to around 30 employees, mostly developers working across different client engagements. But something else was happening alongside the consulting revenue: we were accumulating reusable expertise\u2014internal tools, libraries, patterns, and shortcuts that made us faster every month.\n\nWithout fully realizing it at the time, we were inching toward product.\n\nOne of those internal efforts became a small product we called **Multex Quote**.\n\n---\n\n## Microsoft, Excel, and the birth of Multex Quote\n\nMultex Quote started almost accidentally\u2014because Microsoft needed a story.\n\nMicrosoft was preparing a major announcement of a new product called **Excel**, and in New York they planned to stage different \u201cthemes\u201d showing how Excel could be used in real businesses. One of the themes was **Wall Street**.\n\nBut for \u201cWall Street\u201d to look real, Excel needed something it didn\u2019t have out of the box: live market data.\n\nMicrosoft needed a working demonstration\u2014fast\u2014and the number of developers who understood both Excel and real-time financial data was small. Somehow our name came up, and we got the call: could we build a quick app that pumped real-time quotes into Excel and made it look like Excel could run a real-time portfolio?\n\nJohn and George pulled a full all-nighter. It was absolutely a prototype\u2014hacked together, rushed, not something you\u2019d ship to a client\u2014but it worked. It fed live prices into Excel, and the spreadsheet models updated in real time.\n\nOn a large monitor, it looked like the future.\n\n---\n\n## The Excel announcement and the moment the room leaned in\n\nThe setup was theatrical: a large room staged as \u201cWall Street,\u201d a PC running Excel on a big screen, with prices ticking live\u2014powered by our overnight prototype.\n\nExecutives from financial firms wandered over, drawn in by the motion of real-time data and the implication behind it: *if this works, we can build anything on top of it.*\n\nOne of the people who stopped was from Fidelity Investments: **Jim Stoddard**, who oversaw technology development for Fidelity\u2019s advisor network. He didn\u2019t admire it as a gimmick. He looked at it as a distribution mechanism.\n\nHe asked a simple question: *How can I buy this for my users?*\n\nWe explained the truth\u2014this was only a prototype, and to make it robust enough for real use would require serious development.\n\nJim offered us a deal we couldn\u2019t refuse.\n\nFidelity would fund the development. In exchange, Fidelity advisors would be allowed to use it at no cost. And crucially, once it was complete, **we would retain the rights** to the product.\n\nIt was a rare kind of corporate agreement: a major institution paying to turn a prototype into a product\u2014while letting the small company keep the upside.\n\nWe agreed.\n\nOver roughly six months we built a real, working product: a system that linked market quotes into Excel models in real time, giving users a way to build and run portfolio analytics directly inside a spreadsheet.\n\n---\n\n## Commercial distribution through Microsoft\n\nThen we got another break.\n\nSomeone at Microsoft\u2014likely the same person who\u2019d originally contacted us\u2014heard what the Fidelity-funded prototype had become. Microsoft offered us a promotional opportunity that would have been impossible for a small firm to buy outright.\n\nWe printed brochures for Multex Quote explaining how it fed quotes into Excel using Microsoft\u2019s real-time data interchange technology called **DDE**. We shipped stacks of brochures to Microsoft\u2019s production facility. Microsoft inserted one into every Excel package shipped to customers.\n\nFor the cost of printing, we were suddenly in the hands of every Excel buyer.\n\nRequests started coming in. We sold many copies. Financially it wasn\u2019t massive, but something more valuable happened: **reputation**.\n\nMultex Quote created an impression that Multex was bigger than it really was\u2014a product company, not just a consulting shop. And that impression traveled faster than the product itself.\n\n---\n\n## Market data vendors circle: Reuters, Telerate, ADP\n\nThat buzz reached the big market data vendors\u2014companies whose entire business depended on quote distribution and terminals.\n\nBefore long we were in serious conversations with the major players of the time: **Telerate, Reuters, and ADP Brokerage**. They saw Multex Quote not as a clever Excel add-on, but as a wedge\u2014a way to push their data deeper into the day-to-day workflows of analysts and advisors.\n\nEventually, **ADP** offered to acquire Multex.\n\nAnd that brought me back to Mody.\n\nMody and I went to ADP\u2019s office to negotiate terms.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can do either of these next:\n\n1) **Turn the last line into a strong scene** (you and Mody walking into ADP, the vibe, the power imbalance, the negotiation tension, what you wanted vs. what they wanted).  \n2) **Create a cleaner chapter structure** (with headings and transitions so this reads like a memoir chapter rather than notes).  \n\nWhich direction fits your \u201cMultex\u201d tone better\u2014more memoir/reflective, or more fast-paced/scene-driven?",

          "content": "## 11. Spin-out and the founding of Multex II\n\nBy 1989, we\u2019d done what we came to ADP to do. The deliverables were complete, FS Partner was real in the market, and my own energy was already drifting toward what came next. The separation from ADP didn\u2019t happen with a dramatic resignation or a slammed door\u2014it was gradual, practical, almost civilized.\n\nA lot of that was because of **Bob Casale**.\n\nBob was, in every sense that mattered, a gentleman. He didn\u2019t treat my desire to leave as betrayal, and he didn\u2019t try to squeeze every last ounce out of the acquisition on the way out. Instead, we worked out an arrangement that was so generous it almost didn\u2019t feel like corporate America.\n\nBob and I agreed on this: in return for the Multex team continuing to provide technical support for FS Partner for the next two years, ADP would let us keep using the existing office space and would pay us a retainer\u2014something like **$2 million a year**\u2014during that period.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just a bridge. It was a runway.\n\nIn effect, Bob was handing me back the Multex Systems business\u2014reconstituted, stabilized, and funded\u2014and giving me time to rebuild without the usual chaos that comes with starting over.\n\nSo I went back to what I knew. Pre-ADP Multex. Find clients with hard problems and build technical solutions for them on a consulting basis.\n\nOne of our first clients was a startup in the medical systems world. In today\u2019s language, you\u2019d probably call them a *big data* company. They were building a large data repository and planning to package it as an information product for hospitals. Our team built the underlying technology platform.\n\nBecause they were a startup, they were financed by venture capital. One of their VC investors was **Euclid Partners**. At some point I presented the platform we\u2019d built to Euclid\u2014part product demo, part architectural walkthrough, the kind of meeting where you\u2019re not just showing what works, you\u2019re trying to convince someone that the thing will scale and survive.\n\nEuclid\u2019s representative in the room was a young associate named **Fred Wilson**.\n\nFred was around 27 or 28 at the time, and he was just starting in venture capital. Euclid was his first VC job. He listened closely, asked sharp questions, and\u2014what stood out to me\u2014he seemed interested not only in the technology but in the people behind it.\n\nAt the end of the discussion, he asked a question that shifted the entire conversation:\n\n\u201cWhat else is your team working on? Do you have other products in mind?\u201d\n\nI still had Merrill\u2019s research distribution idea in my head\u2014the one Jim Tousignant had pushed hard, and the one I\u2019d initially dismissed as not exciting enough. But the idea hadn\u2019t gone away. It had been sitting there, quietly, like something unfinished.\n\nSo I told Fred about it: the concept of distributing financial research electronically\u2014using existing networks\u2014at a time when printing and mailing research was costing firms like Merrill tens of millions of dollars a year.\n\nFred\u2019s reaction was immediate. He leaned in.\n\nHe said the concept was not only interesting\u2014it was fundable.\n\nThen he asked the question I hadn\u2019t yet learned was a gateway drug to an entirely different life:\n\n\u201cWould you be interested in venture funding for something like that?\u201d\n\nI said yes.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain how little I understood about venture capital at that moment. I knew nothing about term sheets, valuation, preferences, boards, or what it meant to build a company designed to scale fast. But that conversation was my first real introduction to the VC world\u2014and to the idea that you could build a business around a product and finance growth with outside capital rather than consulting revenue.\n\nThat was the starting point of **Multex II**.\n\nThe \u201cnew Multex\u201d would take seven years from that early conception to an IPO in 1999\u2014at the peak of the first internet boom. Then came four years of operating as a public company. And in 2003, we sold it to **Reuters**.\n\nBut the seed of all of that\u2014IPO, public company, exit\u2014was planted in a much smaller moment: a VC associate in his first job asking what else we were building, and me realizing, almost mid-sentence, that maybe the idea I\u2019d been calling \u201cnot exciting\u201d was actually the next big thing.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can take this further in one of two ways:\n\n1) **Make the Euclid/Fred scene more cinematic** (room details, your internal thoughts, sharper dialogue, the moment you decide to mention the Merrill idea).  \n2) **Bridge this directly into the first concrete steps of Multex II** (what the product *was*, who the initial team was, how you validated demand, what Merrill/others said, early prototype decisions, etc.).\n\nWhich do you want next: more *scene*, or more *momentum into building*?",

          "content": "## Multex II\n\nMultex II was a very different business than Multex I. Multex I was primarily a service business. The service work was a means to provide a living for me and my employees. Even then, I was always dreaming about building products, but I didn\u2019t really know there were other options. I thought you either had enough revenue to fund your growth, or you didn\u2019t have a business.\n\nFrom my first meeting with Fred, I realized there was another path\u2014if you could get venture capitalists interested in supporting your efforts. At that first meeting, Fred made it sound easy. I was just starting to learn what \u201ceasy\u201d really meant.\n\nThe truth is, raising VC money is its own story. By the time Multex went public, I had a real education in what it means to build a VC-backed company. Eventually we raised more than $50 million in five or six rounds\u2014A through F, if I remember correctly\u2014and I pitched to, negotiated with, and answered to a substantial number of investors.\n\nStill, I don\u2019t want this chapter to overdo the venture-capital angle. I want it to be about my experience building a product business and the education I received in the process\u2014about leadership, decision-making, markets, and what it means to be a businessman and an entrepreneur. Along the way I was also learning about life in America\u2014New York\u2019s version of it, to be more precise.\n\nMost of my early VC education was facilitated by Fred. He was learning the discipline himself, but he was generous in sharing what he knew and what he was learning. Over time, I learned to trust him and rely on his advice and judgment. I have known Fred now for almost 35 years\u2014nearly the span of both our careers. Today he is a close friend and colleague, and a very successful and well-known VC. But that\u2019s decades later. Back then, he was the person helping me understand a world I didn\u2019t yet speak fluently.\n\n### Series A: Euclid Partners\n\nAfter our first meeting, Fred introduced me to the rest of the firm and, more importantly, to Milton Pappas, his senior partner and mentor. Milton was from a different generation\u2014almost my parents\u2019 generation\u2014but I came to know and appreciate him. In his own way, he helped me learn how VCs think and how to survive in their ecosystem.\n\nOur Series A round, led by Euclid Partners with Fred, was one of the hardest\u2014like most first rounds. Mody and I each committed $100,000 to show personal dedication. Euclid, after extensive due diligence, invested about $1 million. If I remember correctly, the round totaled roughly $1.2 million, with $200,000 from Mody and me and Euclid covering the rest.\n\nThat money started Multex on the path to becoming a VC-backed product company. It also started me on a personal journey toward building and running what would become one of the early Internet-based public companies.\n\nOnce the initial financing was in our bank account, one of the first things we did was look for space. Our arrangement with ADP was coming to an end, and our contract with them was expiring. We needed an office we controlled.\n\nWe sublet space in the financial district of lower Manhattan, downtown\u2014a location that would become our favorite for much of the next decade. The address was 32 Maiden Lane, directly across from the Federal Reserve. The office was fully furnished and had room for about 50 people. At the time we had just over 20, and my first reaction was worry. It felt like far too much space for a company still learning to walk.\n\nBut the rent was remarkably low\u2014about $13 per square foot\u2014and Mody convinced me to take it. In less than a year, we filled the space. That decision was an early reminder that a product company has to think ahead of its current footprint.\n\n### Multex Net: Building the Network Before the Internet\n\nThe first iteration of our product was built at a time when the Internet was not yet a practical delivery platform for business-critical systems. In those days, if you were building a networking product, you often had to build the network itself. Another major challenge was choosing a portable document format that could support the electronic delivery of research.\n\nLuck is always part of any successful business. Multex had two lucky breaks without which we might not have succeeded. The first was the Internet becoming mainstream. The second was the announcement\u2014and eventual proliferation\u2014of PDF as a portable document format.\n\nBefore either force fully reshaped the world, we built what we called Multex Net. The \u201cNet\u201d was not a marketing flourish. The proprietary network was arguably the most important part of the product.\n\n### A Proprietary, IP-Based Distributed Network Architecture\n\nWe built Multex Net as a Windows/PC-based user interface that connected over a local network to a server running on the client\u2019s premises. That server connected through a frame-relay based TCP/IP wide-area network to our central system. Our central system ran the central repository\u2014a database that accumulated all the research documents contributed to us by research providers. Those providers, in turn, ran a server connected to a Windows/PC-based contribution application we supplied.\n\nThe whole system had a two-tier star configuration, essentially a two-level graph. (See Figure 1, TBD.) Technically, it worked. But it created serious business and operational challenges.\n\nThe first was cost. Wide-area connections were not cheap, and neither was the hardware\u2014servers, routers, and telecommunications equipment. In theory, if you built enough scale, it could become cost-effective and form a moat. In practice, scaling the build-out required significant capital.\n\nThe second challenge was support. To install and maintain equipment at client sites, you need an organization built for deployment and field support. That kind of operational burden can grow quickly and become a limiting factor.\n\nStill, with Euclid\u2019s initial investment, we got the system off the ground and started installing early adopter clients\u2014both research providers and institutional investors.\n\nWe also faced a classic two-sided-market problem: the system needed a critical mass of both providers and consumers to be valuable to either side. And we had to convince both sides that we could reach that critical mass.\n\nIn our case, one of the most important forces that helped us get there was the presence of a competitor.\n\n### First Call: The Monopoly the Market Resented\n\nAt the time, there was only one company offering something even somewhat similar to what we were trying to build: First Call, part of Thomson Financial.\n\nTheir technology was inferior and limited. They delivered only a small subset of research\u2014\u201cmorning notes\u201d\u2014in text format through a broadcast system. It was essentially a broadcast of the snippets that research organizations submitted in the morning. Once delivered, that information could not be changed, and there was no meaningful historical review. And of course, morning notes were only a small fraction of what research departments actually produced.\n\nBut First Call had one crucial advantage: it was unique. It offered an electronic stream of research, effectively a research newswire, and it enjoyed the benefits of monopoly status. It charged both contributors and consumers very high prices, and both sides\u2014powerful financial institutions\u2014resented being beholden to a company that behaved like an arrogant monopoly.\n\nThat\u2019s why, when we appeared, many firms didn\u2019t just show interest\u2014they wanted us to succeed. The market wanted a legitimate competitor.\n\nOur arrival was generally welcomed by investment banks and brokerages (the producers of research, the sell-side) and by investment management firms (the consumers of research, the buy-side). Throughout our existence, that dynamic helped us. The market tended to see us as technologically advanced, nimble, and flexible\u2014the \u201cgood guys\u201d\u2014and First Call as retrograde and inflexible\u2014the \u201cbad guys.\u201d\n\nOf course, competing against a large, well-funded incumbent was never easy. At times they nearly killed us. One of the most memorable sequences started in the summer of 1993.\n\n### Adobe and the Announcement of PDF\n\nWe first ran into First Call directly at Adobe\u2019s announcement of PDF. It was the summer of 1993, in New York, in one of the big hotels.\n\nBy then we had an early version of Multex Net running\u2014at least enough to demonstrate capabilities. Jim somehow got us invited to present, along with Dr. John Warnock, Adobe\u2019s co-founder, as an early adopter of PDF technology. We used an early beta version of the PDF reader in our product.\n\nSitting in the audience, not far from me, was the CTO of First Call with several colleagues. They watched our presentation closely, and it was obvious they were concerned that we might be moving into their territory.\n\nShortly after that, we discovered First Call was working on a product that would be directly competitive with ours.\n\nAbout a year later, we had made early progress in the market. We had contributors and users, and they were not small names. On the sell-side we had Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs. On the buy-side we had T. Rowe Price, Prudential, and others. These firms became early supporters and early adopters, and their support mattered.\n\n### Fidelity\u2019s Acquisition Offer\u2014And How It Collapsed\n\nFidelity Investments became interested in our product as well. Fidelity was technologically advanced and, in that era, one of the most acquisitive firms in technology. They began to consider acquiring Multex.\n\nAt that point we had largely used up our first investment round and were thinking about what our next move should be. Fidelity\u2019s interest was timely, and for me personally it was significant. They offered $20 million for the company, along with continued funding and resources to develop the product.\n\nThe strategic logic was obvious. With Fidelity\u2019s influence, our hardest task\u2014getting the sell-side firms to contribute research\u2014would become much easier. With enough content contributed by the sell-side, the value to the buy-side would increase dramatically. And because we were still operating on a proprietary network and needed major funding to roll it out, Fidelity\u2019s financial backing could change the trajectory of the company.\n\nWe went through extensive due diligence. We met with senior management at Fidelity, including Ned Johnson, the CEO at the time. Everything seemed aligned. In fact, we were one day away from signing the definitive agreement.\n\nThen we received notification that First Call had filed a patent case against us, claiming \u201cprior art\u201d in their technology versus ours.\n\nAs it eventually turned out, it was bogus. We clearly had prior art: First Call didn\u2019t even have a comparable product when we were already publicly demonstrating ours. But the filing itself was enough to create risk and uncertainty. Fidelity backed away. The deal was never consummated.\n\nAnd suddenly we were nearly out of money.\n\nWe came very close to shutting the company down.\n\nFred and I began working the phones, contacting potential investors as quickly as we could. One factor that helped us survive that period was a deal we had completed with Bloomberg Financial to become a redistributor of our research database to their customers. We already had a similar deal signed with Reuters. Adding Bloomberg mattered strategically, even though neither relationship materially changed our revenue at that stage.\n\n### Series B: AT&T Ventures\n\nWe ultimately managed to pull together the next round. The main new investor was AT&T Ventures, and the partner who led the investment\u2014and became a board member\u2014was Alessandro Piol. I don\u2019t remember whether we had other new investors outside of Euclid continuing to invest, but once the round closed we were able to keep operating and continue building.\n\n### Subsequent Rounds: Softbank and Chase Ventures\n\nOver the next year or two we raised additional capital from Softbank and Chase Ventures.\n\nSoftbank is a famous name now, but at that time it was much smaller. It was represented by Charley Lax, who joined our board. Even though Multex wasn\u2019t one of Softbank\u2019s famous mega-investments, being in their portfolio gave me access to their world. I met several partners and executives, including Masayoshi Son\u2014although that happened much later, after we were already a public company, when I traveled to Japan for the opening of Multex Investor Japan, a joint venture with Reuters.\n\nChase Ventures was represented by Bob Greene, who also joined our board.\n\nBy this point, the combined VCs held a majority of the company\u2019s equity. That changed the center of gravity in decision-making. Their influence on business and technical direction was no longer advisory\u2014it was structural.\n\n### When the Board Wanted the Internet\u2014and I Wasn\u2019t Sure\n\nOne event from that time stands out vividly. Sometime in the middle of 1995, we had a board discussion that turned into a heated debate.\n\nOur first product architecture had been designed in 1993, when the Internet and the browser were not yet commonplace. Even though the system used TCP/IP, it relied on a proprietary frame-relay network. That network delivered guaranteed throughput and reliability, but it was expensive. To scale it, we would need more capital.\n\nMeanwhile, Internet excitement was rising fast. As usual, VCs were among the first to become intensely enthusiastic. They advocated aggressively that we move to Internet delivery and stop investing in a proprietary private network.\n\nI shared the excitement about the promise of the Internet, but I was worried about the reality. Dial-up speeds were slow. Corporate security teams were cautious. And browsers were primitive. I believed it would be difficult to deliver a robust, information-heavy product reliably over the Internet, and I didn\u2019t want to damage the trust we had earned from early clients.\n\nThe investors pushed hard\u2014hard enough that the message was clear: if I refused, they could replace me as CEO.\n\nThe debate went back and forth over months. Eventually we reached a compromise. We would implement an Internet/browser-based version of the product, but we would continue to offer clients both a dedicated network and an Internet version.\n\nFor a while, that hybrid approach worked. Then the Internet adoption curve shocked us. Before long, the browser-based version became the only version we sold.\n\nAt the same time, we had users who loved the dynamic interface of the older software. We ended up migrating that proprietary interface to work over the Internet so we could offer an Internet-connected version with an active desktop front end. Today, this combination\u2014browser version plus a \u201cnative\u201d desktop application\u2014is common. At the time, it was early.\n\nThe Internet changed everything for us: cost, support, market perception, and our ability to become a public company.\n\nInstead of paying for proprietary infrastructure and operations, many of those costs effectively disappeared. If clients had decent Internet access, all they had to do was point their browsers to our URL. Our operational burden dropped dramatically as well; we no longer had to install and support the same level of equipment on customer premises.\n\nAnd then there was the perception shift. The Internet became the story. Being labeled an \u201cInternet company\u201d changed how customers, investors, and banks looked at you.\n\n### The Internet Bubble\n\nYoung Internet companies began going public at a pace that quickly became irrational. Netscape IPO\u2019d on August 9, 1995, just a year after being founded. That was the beginning of what became the Internet bubble.\n\nAt that time it often didn\u2019t matter whether a company had meaningful revenue, or even a realistic plan. If it had \u201c.com\u201d in its name, it could attract capital and public-market attention. Many companies that shouldn\u2019t have been funded went public.\n\nNaturally, we were swept up in that wave too.\n\nBy 1998\u20131999 we had established meaningful name recognition in the industry and reached approximately $20 million in revenue. We were not yet profitable, but we were growing rapidly\u2014close to 100% annually. Compared to many so-called Internet companies at the time, we looked like a serious candidate for an IPO within a year or two.\n\nBut the market was not just hot\u2014it was super-hot. With investor pressure and momentum behind us, we decided to go public while the window was wide open.\n\n### Building Up to the IPO\n\nBecause our market was what today would be called FinTech\u2014but at that time was described as a \u201cvertical\u201d market, not a consumer story\u2014we were not seen as the most fashionable IPO candidate. Still, investment banks were eager to win mandates, and they courted us aggressively.\n\nEventually we selected three firms to prepare us for an IPO, in this order:\n1. Robertson Stephens, a San Francisco-based specialty investment bank  \n2. CIBC Oppenheimer, a New York-based investment bank  \n3. Dain Rauscher Wessels, a Midwest-based investment bank  \n\nEven though I had run the business for more than four years and raised substantial venture capital by then, I was still na\u00efve about IPOs and what the process demanded. One of my VC investors suggested hiring a private coach to prepare me for the roadshow.\n\nIt turned out to be a good decision.\n\nMy coach was a woman in her sixties who smoked like a chimney. She was tough and practical, and she knew exactly what the public markets expected. She took me clothes shopping. She worked with me on presence and comfort in front of an audience. She pushed me to be concise and direct, and she taught me how to present a story that was both credible and compelling.\n\nI remember that preparation period with genuine fondness. It was not just training for an IPO roadshow. It was part of my education in what it meant to lead a company at a higher level\u2014where the story, the numbers, the strategy, and the person delivering them all had to align.",

      "content": "The Multex story starts sometime in 1981. I came to this country in May of 1980 and at that time was working for Golding Industries, my second job in the US. I oversaw a small computing system for Golding. Mostly I was doing software development for this textile manufacturing company, but also was responsible for the operation of the system. It was an IBM mainframe computer running an online system called CICS. The reason I am mentioning it, is because it\u2019s relevant to how I got interested in PCs.  CICS - Customer Information Control System is a family of mixed language application servers that provide online transaction management and connectivity for applications on IBM Mainframe systems under z/OS and z/VSE. Wikipedia While developing the system, I had to create a utility to remotely print invoices at the manufacturing plant that operated in South Carolina. It was a pretty challenging task as at that time the system didn\u2019t support direct programing of a remote printer and the utility had to be programed at a machine code level. I managed to finish the job successfully but the difficulty of doing it stuck in my mind. Even when I was still in Russia while listening to voice of America, I heard about a new technology development Personal Computers. According to the story they were so small and affordable that a person was able to buy it for personal use. This got me very fascinated, and I knew that once I settle a bit in America, I will investigate it.  By fall of 1981 both my wife and I were working for close to a year as software developers and, although we were earning low salaries by US standards, but nevertheless, given our reasonably modest expectations, we thought that we are pretty stable financially. We lived in a rented apartment in Brooklyn with a minimal amount of furniture, just the necessities, but compared to the conditions at that time in the former USSR, we were quite happy with our lifestyle.  That\u2019s when I remembered about my dream of owning a personal computer and started to investigate what\u2019s available in the market. The most popular systems at that time were Apple II and TRS-80. Although IBM PC was already announced it wasn\u2019t clear that it\u2019ll be the market leader it eventually became. But because I was working on an IBM system and was a big believer in IBMs dominance in the computing market (as it was at that time) I have decided that my personal computer should be an IBM PC. I think that it was the most expensive PC at that time, but I had my heart set on it and I\u2019ve started to think where and how will I get the money to get a fully configured system. Just for the fun of it I\u2019ll list the system configuration of my first PC. It had a 64KB of internal memory (the MAC I am using to write this story has 32GB of internal memory, 32,000,000,000 vs 64,000). For permanent/external storage the PC had two floppy disk drives 320KB each. It also had a dot matrix printer. If I remember correctly its output was 10 characters per second.   Even though by today\u2019s standards this is quite a pathetic system, at that time it was very reasonable, and most importantly, it was programable and a full-blown computing system with all the attributes of a real computer.  It wasn\u2019t cheap either. A system configured as above cost over $5,000 at an IBM retail store when they opened them in New York. In today\u2019s money it would be over $14,000. But I was determent to get one and was looking for a way to raise the funds. It was a lot of money for me at the time. My annual salary I think was $24,000. So, it was almost a quarter of my pre-tax annual earnings. And given that we were working for just a year, starting from a complete scratch, that was a lot of money. We didn\u2019t have any meaningful savings, so I started to look into getting a personal loan from a bank.  Obviously since I was such a short time in the country and employed for just a year I had a very limited credit history and the bank wouldn\u2019t give me a loan. But they said that if I found a guarantor with a good credit history, they would give me a loan, assuming he would co-sign the application. I had a friend who lived in our neighborhood and was a volunteer English teacher in our local synagogue, Mody Zeidman. He was a lawyer and a native New Yorker. So obviously his credit line was good. At that point I didn\u2019t live in the country long enough to understand that I am asking for a very material commitment and trust. But Mody agreed without any hesitation. Through this transaction he really became my partner in a few ventures, including Multex, that I have started a few years later. With Mody\u2019s guaranty on my personal loan application I got a $6,000 loan from the bank. And happily, proceeded to the IBM store to pick up my new computer. Here\u2019s the picture of me in our Brooklyn apartment, at the only table we had, getting things figured out with my new computer.     I am semi naked because it\u2019s summer and hot, and we don\u2019t yet have an air conditioner, but do have a computer \uf04a. Once I got the system home and set it up I started to learn its architecture and how to program it. Software wise it was quite limited. It didn\u2019t even have a text processor that would let you edit a whole page, but only had a line editor. You had to edit a line at a time when you wrote your program. For programming it had only Basic and of course Assembler for Intel\u2019s 8088 processor.  I\u2019ve decided, as my first project, to write a full-page text editor, similar to the one I was used to on the IBM mainframe that I was using at work. It turned out to be a pretty challenging project. While doing it I realized that with some creativity I can make the program write not only in English, but also in Russian (and any other language that I would know the alphabet of) and make it write not only left to right but also right to left.  At that time my best friend Gera Ginzburg lived in Israel. He left USSR almost a year ahead of me. So, when I talked to him over the phone, I was excitedly telling him about the PC and the project I was working on. Gera was also a software engineer and right away suggested that I should make my text editor support Hebrew alphabet and make it write right to left. I agreed and expanded my project to support Hebrew.  As the project grew, I engaged two of my friends Gera in Israel and Igor Saxonov, who somebody introduced me to and who lived not far from me in Brooklyn, to help me work on the project and to turn my text editor into a word processor.  Without going into a lot of details I\u2019ll just say that within a year, while working at nights, the three of us eventually developed the product into a multilingual word processor. So now we had a product that at that time was somewhat unique given how small the software market for IBM PC was. But what can we do with it and how we can \u201ccommercialize\u201d it the three of us, being recent emigrants from a \u201ccommunist\u201d country, had not a clue.",

So I did what you did in those days: I went down to the metal. I wrote a utility at the machine-code level and made it work.\n\nI was proud of it. But I also couldn\u2019t forget how hard it had been just to do something so basic\u2014send words to paper.\n\nEven before I left the USSR, I\u2019d heard rumors of a new kind of technology while listening to Voice of America: *personal computers.* Small enough to sit on a desk.

I\u2019m half naked because it was summer, hot, and we didn\u2019t have an air conditioner yet. But we had a computer.)\n\nOnce everything was connected and powered up, I started to learn the machine the way I always learned machines: by taking it apart with code.\n\nThe software was primitive. There wasn\u2019t even a real text editor\u2014just a line editor. You edited one line at a time. For programming you had BASIC and, if you were brave, assembler for Intel\u2019s 8088.\n\nI decided my first project would be a full-screen text editor, like the one I used on the IBM mainframe at work.\n\nIt was harder than I expected. But while building it I realized something that would later become the heart of everything: if I controlled the screen and the keyboard mapping, I didn\u2019t have to stop at English. With some creativity, I could make it write in Russian\u2014or any alphabet I understood. And I could make it go not only left to right, but right to left.\n\nMy best friend, Gera Ginzburg, was living in Israel then. He had left the USSR almost a year before me. When I told him what I was building, he immediately said: \u201cMake it support Hebrew. Make it write right to left.\u201d\n\nHe was right. And once the idea was spoken out loud, there was no going back.\n\nI brought in Gera in Israel and Igor Saxonov in Brooklyn\u2014someone I\u2019d been introduced to\u2014and the three of us worked nights. We kept pushing the editor until it became something bigger: a multilingual word processor.\n\nWithin a year, we had a product that felt unusual for the early IBM PC market.\n\nAnd then we hit a new problem.\n\nWe had built it.\n\nBut we had absolutely no idea what to do with it.\n\n---\n\n## Two options for the ending line (choose based on tone)\nIf you want it reflective:\n- *\u201cWe had escaped one system where everything was planned. Now we were in the opposite world\u2014and we didn\u2019t know the first thing about selling.\u201d*\n\nIf you want it punchier:\n- *\u201cIn the USSR we didn\u2019t know how to start a business. In America, we were about to find out\u2014fast.\u201d*\n\n---\n\nIf you want, paste the next section you\u2019re planning (the first attempt to sell it, forming K&S Software, first ads/distribution, etc.), and I\u2019ll help you shape the commercialization arc so it builds tension: first tiny wins, first humiliations, first unexpected mentor, first real check.",

At the time I didn\u2019t fully understand what I was asking. In my mind it was just paperwork.\n\nIn America, it was trust.\n\nMody agreed without hesitation.\n\nWith Mody\u2019s signature, the bank gave me a $6,000 loan. I went to the IBM store and brought home my computer. I still remember setting it up on the only table we owned.\n\n(There\u2019s a photo from that day. I\u2019m half naked because it was summer, hot, and we didn\u2019t have an air conditioner yet. But we had a computer.)\n\nOnce everything was connected and powered up, I started to learn the machine the way I always learned machines: by taking it apart with code.\n\nThe software was primitive. There wasn\u2019t even a real text editor\u2014just a line editor. You edited one line at a time. For programming you had BASIC and, if you were brave, assembler for Intel\u2019s 8088.\n\nI decided my first project would be a full-screen text editor, like the one I used on the IBM mainframe at work.\n\nIt was harder than I expected. But while building it I realized something that would later become the heart of everything: if I controlled the screen and the keyboard mapping, I didn\u2019t have to stop at English. With some creativity, I could make it write in Russian\u2014or any alphabet I understood. And I could make it go not only left to right, but right to left.\n\nMy best friend, Gera Ginzburg, was living in Israel then. He had left the USSR almost a year before me. When I told him what I was building, he immediately said: \u201cMake it support Hebrew. Make it write right to left.\u201d\n\nHe was right. And once the idea was spoken out loud, there was no going back.\n\nI brought in Gera in Israel and Igor Saxonov in Brooklyn\u2014someone I\u2019d been introduced to\u2014and the three of us worked nights. We kept pushing the editor until it became something bigger: a multilingual word processor.\n\nWithin a year, we had a product that felt unusual for the early IBM PC market.\n\nAnd then we hit a new problem.\n\nWe had built it.\n\nBut we had absolutely no idea what to do with it. In the USSR we didn\u2019t know how to start a business. In America, we were about to find out\u2014fast.",

He started to reach out through his meager network to friends and acquaintances.  (expand, include the story of Want brothers, their store in downtown Brooklyn, etc.) Without going into sometime hilarious details, we eventually stumbled into a guy who decided that he will make a software company based on our product. It turned out that even though he was a sophisticated businessman (commodities trader) he was quite na\u00efve at the very young business of PC software.  3.\tSell to a company that used the Word Processor to IPO  My friend Mody Zeidman helped a lot in negotiating and representing us in the convoluted and relatively protracted negotiation process, but eventually we agreed on the terms and price. Only because of Mody\u2019s help we got a pretty substantial for that time price for our product. It was $600,000 for the sale of the product and all of the rights to it \u201clock, stock and barrel\u201d to the company this guy formed specifically for this product.  We walked away from our creation to some degree shocked by the amount of money we got. Just to close the story on the word processor. The new company and the product were named \u201cWorld Master\u201d. Apparently, it IPO-d (I suspect on the AIM market, but don\u2019t know for sure). It didn\u2019t manage to make a lot of progress as it didn\u2019t have any software engineering support. The guy bought the product from, but didn\u2019t engage us to continue to develop it. The company has eventually folded and so our first product didn\u2019t turn into a great commercial success, but the three of us made a fair amount of money (we were equal partners in our little venture). Each walked away with $200,000. By that time, it was already Jan of 1986 and in today\u2019s value it would be over $560,000. Meaningful amount, but for the three recent emigrants it seemed like a lot of money. We felt rich \uf04a.",

      "content": "### Early days of marketing a PC product\n\nOnce we had a multilingual word processor that actually worked, we ran straight into a problem that had nothing to do with software.\n\nWe didn\u2019t know how to sell it.\n\nOf the three of us, Igor was the most entrepreneurial. He didn\u2019t have a \u201cnetwork\u201d in the American sense of the word\u2014none of us did\u2014but he had initiative and a kind of fearless curiosity. He started calling people, asking questions, turning small connections into meetings. Friends of friends. Acquaintances from the neighborhood. Anyone who might know someone who owned a computer store or knew a businessman who was \u201cin computers.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how we began to get introduced to the early PC world in Brooklyn\u2014small storefronts, cramped back offices, people learning the business as they went along. We\u2019d bring disks, do demonstrations, talk too much, and listen carefully. Sometimes we were taken seriously. Sometimes we weren\u2019t. Sometimes we were sure we were in the middle of a real business conversation, only to realize later that we were speaking different languages\u2014not Russian and English, but \u201cengineering\u201d and \u201csales.\u201d\n\nThrough this meager chain of introductions, we eventually found our way to the Want brothers and their store in downtown Brooklyn. In those days, a computer store wasn\u2019t a sleek showroom\u2014it was more like a workshop with a cash register. Boxes stacked to the ceiling, machines in various states of assembly, printers chattering in the background, customers asking basic questions that today would seem unbelievable. The Want brothers were practical people. They understood customers. They understood what sold. And they understood immediately that what we had\u2014especially the ability to handle multiple alphabets, and right-to-left\u2014wasn\u2019t just a technical trick. For the right buyer, it was a market.\n\nOne introduction led to another. Without going into some details that were, in hindsight, almost hilarious, we stumbled into a man who decided he would build a software company around our product.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t a programmer. He wasn\u2019t even from the PC world. He was a sophisticated businessman\u2014a commodities trader\u2014who saw the opportunity before he understood the mechanics. And he was about to learn, the hard way, that early PC software wasn\u2019t like commodities. You couldn\u2019t treat it as a thing you bought and sold and expected to behave by itself. It needed engineering. It needed support. It needed constant improvement.\n\nBut in one crucial respect, he was serious: he wanted to buy the product outright.\n\n### Selling the product\u2014\u201clock, stock and barrel\u201d\n\nBy then, Mody Zeidman had become more than the man who co-signed my bank loan. He was the one American in our orbit who could translate this new world for us: contracts, leverage, negotiation, the quiet power of simply knowing how business is done here.\n\nMody helped us negotiate and represented us through what became a surprisingly convoluted, protracted process. There were terms, conditions, drafts, revisions, and the kind of back-and-forth that feels less like logic and more like endurance\u2014especially when you\u2019re new to the country and still learning how to read between the lines.\n\nIn the end we agreed on a deal that, even now, still feels unreal when I say it out loud.\n\nThe buyer formed a company specifically for our product and purchased it\u2014and all rights to it\u2014*lock, stock and barrel* for **$600,000**.\n\nOnly because of Mody\u2019s help did we get what I believe was a very strong price for that time. We signed the papers and walked away from our creation somewhat stunned by the size of the number. For three recent emigrants who had started from scratch, it didn\u2019t just feel like a business transaction. It felt like proof that we could build something valuable in America.\n\nTo close the loop on the word processor: the new company and product were named **World Master**. Apparently, it eventually went public\u2014I suspect on the AIM market, but I\u2019m not sure. What I do know is that it never made the progress it could have, because it didn\u2019t have software engineering support. The man who bought it didn\u2019t engage us to keep developing it. Without the people who understood the code, the product couldn\u2019t evolve the way the market demanded. In time, the company folded.\n\nSo our first product didn\u2019t become a long-term commercial success.\n\nBut for us personally, it changed everything.\n\nWe were equal partners, and each of us walked away with **$200,000**. By then it was **January 1986**\u2014in today\u2019s value, that would be over **$560,000** each. A meaningful amount of money by any standard. For three recent emigrants, it felt enormous.\n\nWe felt rich. And in the USSR we didn\u2019t know how to start a business. In America, we were about to find out\u2014fast.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also:\n- weave in one or two specific \u201chilarious details\u201d without derailing the seriousness (a miscommunication, a ridiculous store encounter, a na\u00efve pitch moment), and/or\n- add one paragraph that explicitly transitions from this sale into the next chapter: how the money changed your confidence, what it enabled (time, equipment, risk-taking), and why it set the stage for K&S Software and eventually Multex.",

      "content": "While I was working nights on my word processor, during the day I continued to work regular day jobs in the corporate America. After Golding Industries, I had two more jobs, but with my new knowledge of PCs I was now working in companies advanced technology groups responsible for figuring out how PCs could be used in the corporate IT. In Jan of 1986 I was working at Goldman Sachs IT and oversaw a l group called R&D department with the focus on the PC implementation throughout Goldman. I guess the whole experience of the word processor woke up in me an entrepreneur and now I was thinking about my own software business. The opportunity came when my old boss at a company I worked for before Goldman Sachs, called Equitable Insurance, got in touch with me and told me that she is now in charge of the corporate R&D focusing on new technology adoption and implementation at Equitable. She asked me if I can help in a consulting capacity and I gladly agreed, as I saw this as an opportunity to start my own business.  2.\tFounding and early clients  I left Goldman in April of 1986 and started as a consultant working in my friend\u2019s Dolores Bailey R&D department at Equitable. The project grew, and I invited three of my former colleagues from Goldman to join. We formed a new company called Multex Systems where I was the founding partner with majority shareholding, but joined by John Mahoney, George Baird, and Van Negris. All four of us started to work on several projects for Dolores at Equitable. In appreciation of Mody\u2019s role in the sale of word processor I also gave him some equity in Multex Systems. It turned out that his role in negotiating an \u201cexit strategy\u201d for my business was very important again when the time came. This is probably a good time to explain why the name Multex. The name came from the idea of the word processor. At some point when we were thinking about the name for our product someone suggested that multilingual text could be abbreviated to mul-tex. We didn\u2019t use the name then, but it stuck with me and when the time came to name my new business I decided to call it Multex. Multex Systems (Multex I) was mostly a consulting business focusing on development projects for the PC and Windows environment. The main clients were Equitable and Goldman, my former employers, where friends and colleagues invited us back to do specific projects related to PC/Windows development. Gradually the company grew to around 30 employees, software developers that worked on different projects. But along the way, while doing development for clients we have developed substantial expertise and some tools that enabled us to also build some product capability. One of this was a small product we named Multex Quote.  3.\tMicrosoft and the idea of Multex Quote  It originated when Microsoft was planning a big announcement of their new product called Excel. They were planning the announcement in one of the hotels in New York with multiple business themes for Excel use. One of the themes was \u201cWall Street\u201d. But they needed an app functionality that would demonstrate the potential use of Excel on Wall Street. Since the market for app developers working with Wall Street firms was relatively small and since Multex Systems was one of these developers, someone at Microsoft heard about us and asked us to quickly develop an app that would work in combination with Excel and pump real-time quotes into Excel in such a way that Excel would be able to demonstrate \u201cReal-time Portfolio\u201d functionality.  I remember a whole nighter that John and George had to pull to develop this functionality. Obviously, it was a hacked together quick prototype, but it worked for what Microsoft requited and looked very impressive on a large screen monitor that Microsoft provided. 4.\tMicrosoft announcement of Excel and massive interest in real-time link to Excel  So here we were in a large room set up as \u201cWall Street\u201d with a PC set up with a large monitor running Excel with real-time prices fed into it by Multex Quote. The product that was built over night by John and George \uf04a. It looked very impressive and several executives from Wall Street firms came over to see. One of these was a person from Fidelity Investments. Fidelity had a large network of advisors and this guy, Jim Stoddard, oversaw technology development for the advisors. Jim liked the product and asked how he can buy it for his users. We explain that this is only a prototype and to make it into a robust product it would require a substantial development. Then Jim offered us a deal we couldn\u2019t refuse. He said that Fidelity will pay for this development and once it\u2019s fully functional he would let us have the rights for the product assuming we will let the Fidelity advisors to be able to use it at no cost. It was obviously a great deal and we agreed. The development with Fidelity lasted I think about six month or so, and as a result we had a real product that worked in combination with Excel providing real-time quotes into Excel developed models. 5.\tCommercial version of Multex Quote and marketing and distribution through Microsoft  And now we got the another break. Someone at Microsoft, probably the same person that originally got in touch with us, have heard about our new product and made us another great offer. We would need to print a large number of brochures describing Multex Quote and explaining how it feeds quotes into Excel using a Microsoft developed real-time data interchange called DDE. We would need to ship these brochures to Microsoft production facility and they would insert a copy of our brochure into each package of Excel shipped to clients. It was a great deal because for a relatively low cost of producing the brochures we got a free promotion of our product to all of Excel users.   Through this marketing we started to get requests from clients for the Multex Quote and sold, I believe, a large number of copies. Financially it wasn\u2019t very material, but the word spread out and, as it often happens, the impression we created with Multex Quote was much bigger than it was in reality.  6.\tMarket Data vendors interested in Multex Quote, Proposals from all major vendors.  The buzz around it attracted a lot of interest from most of the big Market Data companies of the time. Before too long we were negotiating partnerships or distribution rights with Telerate, Reuters and ADP Brokerage. Eventually ADP offered to acquire Multex. And Mody and I went to their office to negotiate terms.",

I\u2019ve also lightly corrected names/grammar (you can revert any detail to match your memory).\n\n---\n\n## Multex I \u2014 Goldman Sachs and the impetus\n\nNights belonged to my word processor. Days belonged to corporate America.\n\nEven after Golding Industries, I stayed on the \u201cday job\u201d track, but something had changed. Building that word processor had rewired my brain. I wasn\u2019t just learning how software worked\u2014I was learning how opportunity worked. And as PCs started creeping into serious corporate environments, I found myself pulled into advanced technology groups: the teams inside big companies whose job was to figure out what to do with this new, chaotic thing called the personal computer.\n\nBy January of 1986 I was at Goldman Sachs in IT, overseeing an R&D group focused on PC implementation across the firm. Goldman wasn\u2019t a place that experimented casually. Everything had to justify itself. But that was exactly what made it exciting: we were trying to take a tool that had been designed for individuals and force it to become something corporate\u2014secure, supportable, scalable, and useful to people who cared about speed and numbers.\n\nSomewhere in the middle of all that, the idea that I might start my own software business stopped feeling like a fantasy. It started feeling like an inevitability.\n\nThe opportunity arrived through a familiar voice from my past.\n\nMy old boss from Equitable Insurance\u2014Dolores Bailey\u2014reached out. She had moved into a role leading corporate R&D, focused on adopting and implementing new technology across Equitable, and she asked if I could help in a consulting capacity.\n\nI said yes immediately. Not just because it sounded interesting, but because I recognized what it really was: a door.\n\nConsulting meant I could do what I already knew how to do\u2014build\u2014and get paid for it, without asking anyone\u2019s permission. It was the cleanest bridge between \u201ccorporate employee\u201d and \u201centrepreneur\u201d that I could imagine.\n\n---\n\n## Founding Multex Systems (Multex I) and early clients\n\nIn April of 1986, I left Goldman and began consulting with Dolores\u2019s R&D group at Equitable. The work grew quickly\u2014enough that it didn\u2019t make sense to do it alone. I brought in three former Goldman colleagues: John Mahoney, George Baird, and Van Negris.\n\nTogether, we formed Multex Systems.\n\nI was the founding partner and majority shareholder, but the company was built as a true team effort from day one. We immediately started delivering multiple projects for Equitable\u2014practical PC and early Windows development work that big organizations wanted, but didn\u2019t yet have the internal muscle to execute consistently.\n\nI also gave Mody equity in Multex Systems. At the time it was partly appreciation for his role in the word processor sale, but it turned out to be more than that. Mody had a way of thinking about \u201cexit strategy\u201d before most people even admitted exits existed. When the time came again, that mindset proved important.\n\nAnd this is probably the best moment to explain the name: **Multex**.\n\nYears earlier, while naming the word processor, someone had tossed out an abbreviation for \u201cmultilingual text\u201d\u2014*mul-tex*. We never used it then, but it stuck in my head like a brand waiting for its product. When it came time to name the company, I pulled it off the shelf.\n\nMultex Systems\u2014Multex I\u2014was primarily a consulting firm: custom development projects for PC and Windows environments. Our first major clients were Equitable and Goldman\u2014both former employers\u2014where friends and colleagues pulled us back in for specific projects.\n\nThe company gradually grew to around 30 employees, mostly developers working across different client engagements. But something else was happening alongside the consulting revenue: we were accumulating reusable expertise\u2014internal tools, libraries, patterns, and shortcuts that made us faster every month.\n\nWithout fully realizing it at the time, we were inching toward product.\n\nOne of those internal efforts became a small product we called **Multex Quote**.\n\n---\n\n## Microsoft, Excel, and the birth of Multex Quote\n\nMultex Quote started almost accidentally\u2014because Microsoft needed a story.\n\nMicrosoft was preparing a major announcement of a new product called **Excel**, and in New York they planned to stage different \u201cthemes\u201d showing how Excel could be used in real businesses. One of the themes was **Wall Street**.\n\nBut for \u201cWall Street\u201d to look real, Excel needed something it didn\u2019t have out of the box: live market data.\n\nMicrosoft needed a working demonstration\u2014fast\u2014and the number of developers who understood both Excel and real-time financial data was small. Somehow our name came up, and we got the call: could we build a quick app that pumped real-time quotes into Excel and made it look like Excel could run a real-time portfolio?\n\nJohn and George pulled a full all-nighter. It was absolutely a prototype\u2014hacked together, rushed, not something you\u2019d ship to a client\u2014but it worked. It fed live prices into Excel, and the spreadsheet models updated in real time.\n\nOn a large monitor, it looked like the future.\n\n---\n\n## The Excel announcement and the moment the room leaned in\n\nThe setup was theatrical: a large room staged as \u201cWall Street,\u201d a PC running Excel on a big screen, with prices ticking live\u2014powered by our overnight prototype.\n\nExecutives from financial firms wandered over, drawn in by the motion of real-time data and the implication behind it: *if this works, we can build anything on top of it.*\n\nOne of the people who stopped was from Fidelity Investments: **Jim Stoddard**, who oversaw technology development for Fidelity\u2019s advisor network. He didn\u2019t admire it as a gimmick. He looked at it as a distribution mechanism.\n\nHe asked a simple question: *How can I buy this for my users?*\n\nWe explained the truth\u2014this was only a prototype, and to make it robust enough for real use would require serious development.\n\nJim offered us a deal we couldn\u2019t refuse.\n\nFidelity would fund the development. In exchange, Fidelity advisors would be allowed to use it at no cost. And crucially, once it was complete, **we would retain the rights** to the product.\n\nIt was a rare kind of corporate agreement: a major institution paying to turn a prototype into a product\u2014while letting the small company keep the upside.\n\nWe agreed.\n\nOver roughly six months we built a real, working product: a system that linked market quotes into Excel models in real time, giving users a way to build and run portfolio analytics directly inside a spreadsheet.\n\n---\n\n## Commercial distribution through Microsoft\n\nThen we got another break.\n\nSomeone at Microsoft\u2014likely the same person who\u2019d originally contacted us\u2014heard what the Fidelity-funded prototype had become. Microsoft offered us a promotional opportunity that would have been impossible for a small firm to buy outright.\n\nWe printed brochures for Multex Quote explaining how it fed quotes into Excel using Microsoft\u2019s real-time data interchange technology called **DDE**. We shipped stacks of brochures to Microsoft\u2019s production facility. Microsoft inserted one into every Excel package shipped to customers.\n\nFor the cost of printing, we were suddenly in the hands of every Excel buyer.\n\nRequests started coming in. We sold many copies. Financially it wasn\u2019t massive, but something more valuable happened: **reputation**.\n\nMultex Quote created an impression that Multex was bigger than it really was\u2014a product company, not just a consulting shop. And that impression traveled faster than the product itself.\n\n---\n\n## Market data vendors circle: Reuters, Telerate, ADP\n\nThat buzz reached the big market data vendors\u2014companies whose entire business depended on quote distribution and terminals.\n\nBefore long we were in serious conversations with the major players of the time: **Telerate, Reuters, and ADP Brokerage**. They saw Multex Quote not as a clever Excel add-on, but as a wedge\u2014a way to push their data deeper into the day-to-day workflows of analysts and advisors.\n\nEventually, **ADP** offered to acquire Multex.\n\nAnd that brought me back to Mody.\n\nMody and I went to ADP\u2019s office to negotiate terms.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can do either of these next:\n\n1) **Turn the last line into a strong scene** (you and Mody walking into ADP, the vibe, the power imbalance, the negotiation tension, what you wanted vs. what they wanted).  \n2) **Create a cleaner chapter structure** (with headings and transitions so this reads like a memoir chapter rather than notes).  \n\nWhich direction fits your \u201cMultex\u201d tone better\u2014more memoir/reflective, or more fast-paced/scene-driven?",

      "content": "7.\tSell of Multex One to ADP  It was a pretty funny discussion. The gist of it was the following. Mody and I met at the ADP Brokerage offices with Bob Casale and Ralf Koehrer. Bob was the president of the Brokerage division; Ralph ran the front office division in Bob\u2019s organization and was specifically interested to acquire Multex Quote for reasons I\u2019ll explain later. We sat across from each other, Bob and Ralph on one side of a long table and Mody and I on the other. After an introductory small talk Bob asked us how much we want for the company. Mody and I looked at each other and Mody said that we would like to have a private chat before we answer the question. Bob and Ralph left the room.  Again, we looked at each other and Mody asked me what I think. Frankly I had not a clue. I didn\u2019t know how to value a business, realistically this was my first experience in a situation like this, since the sale of K&S was a very different case where we had a product with no revenue, while in this case there actually was a business, with revenue at around $3 million a year, but mostly all of it was from consulting revenue with a really negligible amount coming from sales of Multex Quote. Yet ADP was interested in the product and the team, but not the consulting part. Now days this type of acquisition is called acquihire and is mostly intended for the purpose of hiring a good team of developers with a promising product idea and maybe an early version of the product. It happens quite often and might be very beneficial to an incumbent company when it needs to enter/compete in a new field.  I thought that since we are really selling the product and since realistically it\u2019s a somewhat small product getting a $1 million for it would be great. I underappreciated the fact that the team itself was valuable to ADP, as it turned out much more valuable than the product itself. Frankly Mody also didn\u2019t understand any of these, but he had the right instincts. He looked at me, when I suggested a price of $1 million and said, let\u2019s ask for $7.5 million. I thought that he\u2019s crazy and that ADP will laugh us out of the room. It turned out I was very wrong and if anything, we probably asked too little. When Bob and Ralph came back and Mody announce the price we came up with, Bob right away said, fine. They agreed to this price, but they would like to have it structured as $3.5 million upfront plus $4 million over four years based on certain deliverables. Again a very typical deal structure in an acquihire situation.   We were so shocked that they agreed that we basically did not negotiate on the rest of the terms and agreed to all their conditions about the deliverables. To us even the $3.5 million upfront was way more than we expected. Since it was an acquihire of the Multex team, by today\u2019s standards ADP didn\u2019t pay too much, if anything it was on the low end. But in these days, it wasn\u2019t such a common practice as it is now, and it was a good deal for both sides.  8.\tBuilding of ADP brokerage workstation  The reason ADP Brokerage needed our team is because ADP had a product for the brokerage clients called FS Partner which provided real-time quotes, news and some other front office applications for the brokers of financial institutions. This product was competing with similar products of other vendors, like Reuters, Telerate, Quotron and some others. To demonstrate technical superiority ADP wanted to have their product run on PCs in a common operating system. But the PC DOS available then didn\u2019t have multitasking/multiwindow support required to run multiple applications needed to support the functionality the workstation required. So, ADP decided to build their product using an operating system called Mondrian.  Mondrian was developed based on IBM\u2019s Top-View. IBM\u2019s attempt to compete with the brand-new Microsoft Windows. The product flapped and was later given to Microsoft by IBM, but never officially release by Microsoft either. Nevertheless, ADP Brokerage used it to develop its version of multitasking PC-based market data workstation. At the point they acquired Multex it became obvious that Mondrian is a dead-end and that they need to support an operating system that the marked would accept. Windows was very young, and it wasn\u2019t clear that it\u2019s going to make it either. Specifically, because IBM has announced that they are working on a \u201creal\u201d multitasking/multiwindow operating system called OS/2. And ADP (as many corporate clients and technology pundits at that point) believed that IBM will obviously win, and OS/2 will dominate.  So, ADP in the contract they concludeed with us specified a number of deliverables that we had to develop over the next four year to be paid the rest of the purchase price, the remaining $4 millions, in two or three installments. Essentially, we had to develop, based on our Multex Quote experience a new FS Partner but now on OS/2.  George Baird was the lead developer, and the team has developed the OS/2 version of FS Partner on time and with style. The only problem was that OS/2 didn\u2019t make it into the main league and at the time the product was ready nobody from ADP clients wanted it. Nevertheless we got paid the first installment.  Bob Casale was instrumental in this and overall, Bob behaved as a gentleman relative to making sure we got paid even though the product they got wasn\u2019t wat the clients wanted. But on our side, I also wanted to make sure that ADP would get their money worth in developing a product that the market needed and not only what the letter of the contract required. And we engaged in porting the product we developed to both MS Windows and UNIX. We successfully accomplished this task as well and eventually ADP had a product that ran on any of the operating systems the clients wanted. MS Windows, UNIX X-Windows, and even OS/2.   9.\tCommercial success of FS-Partner  The flexibility of the product we built, and specifically the ability of FS Partner to run on MS Windows and UNIX X-Windows made FS Partner a leader in the brokerage community. And by the end of our four-year terms of our contract with ADP, FS Partner had about 70% of the market of the brokerage workstations in US. So, it was a great success, and we got the rest of our payments. By this time, I was a Senior VP working directly for Bob and was looking for the next challenge career wise and professionally. Bob was trying to give me this challenge, but for multiple reasons that isn\u2019t interesting to discuss here, it wasn\u2019t happening within ADP. This is probably a good time to introduce Jim Tousignant and his role at Multex. Jim was the first salesman we hired at Multex Systems. Probably around the second year of operations. He was very young with very little sales experience, but he was a natural salesman. He was very helpful in the relationship with Microsoft and was very helpful in setting up discussions with market data vendors. After the acquisition by ADP Jim became one of ADP\u2019s sales executives. One of Jim\u2019s accounts was Merrill Lynch. I think it was actually ADP\u2019s biggest brokerage account with around 15K workstations of FS Partner installed. So obviously they had a lot of influence on the relationship and ADP listened to their suggestions and wishes.  10.\tIdea of electronic research distribution product  One day Jim came to me with an idea that Merrill has proposed to ADP. Obviously, at that time in 1989, way before the widespread adoption of Internet, all wide area communications was done using proprietary networks and were quite expensive. To deliver real-time market data ADP has maintained a network that connected its data centers and the client\u2019s locations. Merrill Lynch was one of these clients and understood very well the value of this network. They were thinking how to increase the value of the network and at the same time lower the cost of delivering information services to their internal and external clients.  One of these services was financial research that their research departments were producing in very large quantities. This research, known in the industry as \u201cWall Street Research\u201d was produced by their financial analysts who analyze public companies\u2019 performance, as well as financial markets and other financial instruments. At that point the result of this research would be a printed brochure, often in colors and sometimes reaching many pages of printed materials.  The cost of printing and mailing these research documents was very substantial, reaching tens of millions of dollars per year for a large firm like Merrill, that had hundreds of analysts generating research on thousands of companies, that had to be delivered to hundreds of institutional clients. A few people in Merrill\u2019s research department operations approached this problem creatively and thought that given ADP\u2019s network reach the research documents can be delivered to their clients\u2019 destinations electronically. They discussed this idea with Jim, their ADP representative, with this proposal and Jim got very excited with this opportunity. He came to me to discuss the technical visibility of such an approach. I thought about it and decided that although it\u2019s feasible to do technically, it\u2019s not a very exciting project. Jim disagreed, and we kicked the idea back and force for a while.",

      "content": "## 7. Sale of Multex I to ADP\n\nThe meeting at ADP Brokerage felt formal in the way big-company meetings always do\u2014too much table, too much distance, too much quiet. Mody and I were led into a conference room at ADP\u2019s offices and sat down across from **Bob Casale** and **Ralf Koehrer**.\n\nBob was the president of the Brokerage division. Ralf ran the front-office group inside Bob\u2019s organization, and he had a very specific interest in us\u2014really, in **Multex Quote**\u2014for reasons that would become clear later.\n\nThey did the usual introductory small talk. Then Bob got to the point.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he said, as if he were asking about the weather, \u201chow much do you want for the company?\u201d\n\nMody and I looked at each other. I remember thinking: *This is it. This is the moment where you\u2019re supposed to know what you\u2019re doing.*\n\nInstead, Mody said, politely, \u201cWe\u2019d like a few minutes to discuss privately before we answer.\u201d\n\nBob and Ralf stepped out, leaving us alone in that oversized room.\n\nThe silence after the door shut was its own kind of pressure.\n\nMody turned to me. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\nFrankly, I had no idea. This was my first real acquisition conversation. The sale of the word processor business had been a completely different situation\u2014a product, no real revenue, more potential than proof. **Multex**, on the other hand, was an actual operating company. We had around **$3 million a year in revenue**, but it was mostly consulting. **Multex Quote**\u2014the product ADP cared about\u2014was still a small sliver of that.\n\nLooking back, what ADP was doing would be called an *acquihire*: buying a company primarily for its team and its trajectory, not its current P&L. That kind of deal is common now. Back then it wasn\u2019t a standard playbook, at least not in the way people talked about it.\n\nIn my head, I was pricing a modest add-on product, not a team with momentum.\n\n\u201cIf we could get a million dollars for it,\u201d I said, \u201cthat would be great.\u201d\n\nMody stared at me for a beat\u2014long enough for me to feel my own inexperience hanging in the air. Then he said, calmly:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s ask for **seven and a half million**.\u201d\n\nI thought he was out of his mind. I pictured Bob and Ralf coming back in, laughing politely, and escorting us out like two kids who\u2019d wandered into the wrong building.\n\nBut Mody had something I didn\u2019t have yet: instinct. Not perfect knowledge\u2014instinct. He understood that when a big company wants something badly enough to call you into their office, *your value is already higher than you think*.\n\nWhen Bob and Ralf returned, Mody gave them the number.\n\n\u201cSeven point five.\u201d\n\nBob didn\u2019t blink.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d he said.\n\nThat was it. No outrage. No lecture. No counter at half. Just *fine*\u2014as if he\u2019d already decided before we walked in what it was worth to him.\n\nThey did, however, want to structure the deal: **$3.5 million up front**, plus **$4 million** over the next four years tied to deliverables\u2014exactly the kind of structure that makes sense when you\u2019re buying a team and a direction, not just a product.\n\nWe were so stunned they agreed to the price that we barely negotiated the rest. We accepted their deliverables and their terms almost as-is, because even the upfront amount was far beyond what we\u2019d expected.\n\nBy today\u2019s standards, ADP didn\u2019t overpay for an acquihire. If anything, it was on the low end. But at the time, these deals weren\u2019t routine\u2014and for us, it was a major outcome. It was also, in a strange way, the moment I finally understood Mody\u2019s real value: not what he knew, but the way he thought about leverage, outcomes, and exits before most of us had the vocabulary for any of it.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Building the ADP Brokerage workstation (FS Partner)\n\nADP\u2019s urgency wasn\u2019t about consulting revenue. They didn\u2019t need another consulting firm. They needed a **product team**.\n\nADP Brokerage already had a market data workstation called **FS Partner**. It delivered real-time quotes, news, and front-office functionality to brokers at major financial institutions. The space was competitive\u2014Reuters, Telerate, Quotron, and others\u2014and the differentiation came down to performance, reliability, and the ability to run a modern, multi-application desktop.\n\nThat was the problem: the PC operating systems available at the time weren\u2019t really built for what ADP wanted. **MS-DOS** didn\u2019t have true multitasking and windowing. A workstation needed multiple things running at once\u2014quotes, news, messaging, maybe charting\u2014and the desktop had to behave like a *platform*.\n\nADP had made an unusual choice: they built their workstation on an operating system called **Mondrian**, based on IBM\u2019s **TopView**\u2014IBM\u2019s early attempt to compete with the brand-new Microsoft Windows. TopView never became a market standard. Mondrian, by extension, was clearly a dead end.\n\nWhen they acquired Multex, it became obvious that if ADP wanted to win long-term, they had to bet on an operating system the market would accept. The question was: which one?\n\nAt that moment in time, **Windows was young**, and it wasn\u2019t obvious it would win. Meanwhile IBM was promising something that sounded far more \u201creal\u201d to corporate technologists: **OS/2**. Many people believed IBM would dominate the future the way it dominated the present.\n\nADP believed it too.\n\nThat belief was embedded into our acquisition contract: the deliverables tied to the remaining $4 million were essentially an obligation to build the next-generation FS Partner based on what we\u2019d learned with Multex Quote\u2014only now, rebuilt as a full workstation on **OS/2**.\n\n**George Baird** led the development. Our team delivered the OS/2 version on time\u2014and we delivered it with style.\n\nThe only problem was the market.\n\nOS/2 didn\u2019t become the standard people predicted. By the time our product was ready, ADP\u2019s clients didn\u2019t want it. They wanted what they believed their own customers would support\u2014and that was increasingly **Windows**, and in many institutional environments, **UNIX/X-Windows**.\n\nTo ADP\u2019s credit, we still got paid the first installment. **Bob Casale** was instrumental in that. He behaved like a gentleman\u2014recognizing that we had delivered what we were asked to deliver, even if the industry had shifted underneath the plan.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t want our relationship with ADP to be defined by \u201cwe met the contract.\u201d I wanted ADP to get something that actually mattered in the market.\n\nSo we did what the contract didn\u2019t explicitly require: we ported the workstation to **Microsoft Windows** and to **UNIX/X-Windows**. When we were done, ADP had a workstation product that could run on whatever operating system the client wanted: Windows, UNIX, and yes\u2014OS/2.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Commercial success of FS Partner\n\nThat flexibility changed everything.\n\nFS Partner became a leader in the brokerage workstation community, and by the end of our four-year term, it had captured roughly **70% of the U.S. brokerage workstation market**. We collected the remaining payments.\n\nBy then I was a **Senior VP**, working directly for Bob. On paper, I was exactly where someone with my background was \u201csupposed\u201d to land: senior role, major product, market share, momentum.\n\nBut personally, I was starting to look for the next challenge\u2014something that felt like *creation*, not continuation.\n\nBob tried to give me that challenge inside ADP. For a variety of reasons (not worth detouring into here), it didn\u2019t quite happen.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the point where it makes sense to introduce **Jim Tousignant**.\n\nJim had been the first salesperson we hired at Multex Systems\u2014probably around our second year. He was young and didn\u2019t have much formal sales experience, but he was a natural. He\u2019d been crucial in our Microsoft relationship and in getting us into conversations with the market data vendors.\n\nAfter ADP acquired Multex, Jim became one of ADP\u2019s sales executives. One of his biggest accounts was **Merrill Lynch**\u2014likely ADP Brokerage\u2019s largest customer\u2014with something like **15,000 FS Partner workstations** installed.\n\nWhen Merrill spoke, ADP listened.\n\n---\n\n## 10. The idea that didn\u2019t sound exciting (yet): electronic research distribution\n\nOne day Jim came to me with a proposal Merrill had floated to ADP.\n\nThis was around 1989\u2014long before the internet became a default distribution channel. Wide-area communications were done through **proprietary networks**, and they were expensive. ADP had built and maintained a network connecting its data centers to client locations in order to deliver real-time market data. Merrill was deeply aware of how valuable that network was.\n\nMerrill wanted to increase the network\u2019s value\u2014and at the same time reduce the cost of delivering information to both internal and external clients.\n\nThey had a very specific pain point: **research**.\n\n\u201cWall Street Research\u201d was produced in massive quantities by Merrill\u2019s analysts\u2014reports on public companies, sectors, markets, instruments. At that time, the output was typically a printed document: often long, sometimes in color, distributed constantly.\n\nPrinting and mailing these research packets cost serious money\u2014*tens of millions of dollars a year* for a firm like Merrill. Hundreds of analysts, thousands of companies, and a distribution obligation to institutions all over the country (and beyond). It was industrial-scale paper.\n\nSome smart people in Merrill\u2019s research operations started asking the obvious question:\n\nIf ADP already has a network reaching our sites, why can\u2019t we distribute research electronically?\n\nThey talked to Jim\u2014ADP\u2019s representative\u2014and Jim immediately saw the opportunity. He came to me to ask whether it was technically feasible.\n\nI thought about it and said yes: technically feasible, absolutely.\n\nBut I also told him the truth: it didn\u2019t excite me. Compared to real-time quotes and workstations and all the engineering complexity we\u2019d lived in, \u201celectronic document delivery\u201d sounded\u2026 tame.\n\nJim disagreed. He felt there was something bigger hiding in it.\n\nAnd for a while, we went back and forth\u2014kicking the idea between us\u2014without realizing we were circling the edge of the next Multex.\n\n---\n\n### Quick questions (to make the next rewrite even sharper)\n1) Do you want to name the location/city of the ADP office (or keep it generic)?  \n2) Were the deliverables explicitly **OS/2-only**, or was OS/2 just the \u201cmain\u201d one?  \n3) When you say \u201cUNIX,\u201d do you remember which vendors were common at your clients then (Sun, HP, IBM AIX), or should we keep it broad?\n\nIf you want, I can turn sections 7\u201310 into a more *scene-driven* sequence (more dialogue, more tension, more \u201cyou are there\u201d), while still keeping it memoir-realistic.",

      "content": "### Chapter \u2014 1981: The First PC (Final)\n\nI came to the United States in May of 1980. By then I was working at Golding Industries\u2014my second job in America\u2014doing software development for a textile manufacturing company. The computer I lived inside every day was an IBM mainframe running CICS, an online transaction system that handled everything the business did in real time.\n\nOne task in particular stayed with me.\n\nGolding had a manufacturing plant in South Carolina, and they needed invoices printed there\u2014remotely\u2014without someone manually handling tapes or paper in New York. Today that sounds ordinary. Back then it wasn\u2019t. The system didn\u2019t really \u201csupport\u201d programming a remote printer the way you\u2019d expect. So I did what you did in those days: I went down to the metal. I wrote a utility at the machine-code level and made it work.\n\nI was proud of it. But I also couldn\u2019t forget how hard it had been just to do something so basic\u2014send words to paper.\n\nEven before I left the USSR, I\u2019d heard rumors of a new kind of technology while listening to Voice of America: *personal computers.* Small enough to sit on a desk. Affordable enough\u2014supposedly\u2014that a person could own one. The idea lodged in my head like a splinter: a real computer that belonged to you.\n\nBy the fall of 1981 my wife and I had been working for close to a year. We weren\u2019t making much by American standards, but we had something we hadn\u2019t had before: stability. We lived in a rented apartment in Brooklyn with almost no furniture\u2014just necessities. But compared to what we\u2019d left behind, it felt like freedom.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I remembered my promise to myself: I was going to get a PC.\n\nThe popular machines then were the Apple II and the TRS-80. IBM had announced its PC, but nobody yet knew it would become *the* standard. I chose it anyway. I was working on IBM systems every day, and I believed\u2014almost instinctively\u2014in IBM\u2019s gravity. If I was going to buy a computer with my own money, it had to be an IBM PC.\n\nThe problem was the price.\n\nMy system had 64KB of memory. For storage it had two floppy drives, 320KB each. And a dot-matrix printer that\u2014if I remember correctly\u2014printed at about 10 characters per second. By today\u2019s standards it\u2019s almost comical. The Mac I\u2019m writing this story on has 32GB of memory\u201432,000,000,000 bytes compared to 64,000.\n\nBut in 1981 it was a full-blown computer. A programmable machine. A world.\n\nThe cost was over $5,000 at the IBM retail store when they opened in New York\u2014over $14,000 in today\u2019s money. My annual salary was around $24,000. I had been in the country barely a year. We had no real savings. Still, I was determined.\n\nSo I went to a bank for a personal loan.\n\nThey said no\u2014at least, not without a guarantor. My credit history was too short. If someone with strong credit co-signed, they would do it.\n\nI asked a man named Mody Zeidman.\n\nMody lived in our neighborhood. He volunteered as an English teacher at our synagogue. He was a lawyer\u2014a native New Yorker\u2014with everything I didn\u2019t yet have: a long history in this country, a stable reputation, and the kind of confidence that comes with belonging. At the time I didn\u2019t fully understand what I was asking. In my mind it was just paperwork.\n\nIn America, it was trust.\n\nMody agreed without hesitation.\n\nWith Mody\u2019s signature, the bank gave me a $6,000 loan. I went to the IBM store and brought home my computer. I still remember setting it up on the only table we owned.\n\n(There\u2019s a photo from that day. I\u2019m half naked because it was summer, hot, and we didn\u2019t have an air conditioner yet. But we had a computer.)\n\nOnce everything was connected and powered up, I started to learn the machine the way I always learned machines: by taking it apart with code.\n\nThe software was primitive. There wasn\u2019t even a real text editor\u2014just a line editor. You edited one line at a time. For programming you had BASIC and, if you were brave, assembler for Intel\u2019s 8088.\n\nI decided my first project would be a full-screen text editor, like the one I used on the IBM mainframe at work.\n\nIt was harder than I expected. But while building it I realized something that would later become the heart of everything: if I controlled the screen and the keyboard mapping, I didn\u2019t have to stop at English. With some creativity, I could make it write in Russian\u2014or any alphabet I understood. And I could make it go not only left to right, but right to left.\n\nMy best friend, Gera Ginzburg, was living in Israel then. He had left the USSR almost a year before me. When I told him what I was building, he immediately said: \u201cMake it support Hebrew. Make it write right to left.\u201d\n\nHe was right. And once the idea was spoken out loud, there was no going back.\n\nI brought in Gera in Israel and Igor Saxonov in Brooklyn\u2014someone I\u2019d been introduced to\u2014and the three of us worked nights. We kept pushing the editor until it became something bigger: a multilingual word processor.\n\nWithin a year, we had a product that felt unusual for the early IBM PC market.\n\nAnd then we hit a new problem.\n\nWe had built it.\n\nBut we had absolutely no idea what to do with it. In the USSR we didn\u2019t know how to start a business. In America, we were about to find out\u2014fast.\n\n---\n\n### Early Days of Marketing a PC Product\n\nOnce we had a multilingual word processor that actually worked, we ran straight into a problem that had nothing to do with software.\n\nWe didn\u2019t know how to sell it.\n\nOf the three of us, Igor was the most entrepreneurial. He didn\u2019t have a \u201cnetwork\u201d in the American sense of the word\u2014none of us did\u2014but he had initiative and a kind of fearless curiosity. He started calling people, asking questions, turning small connections into meetings. Friends of friends. Acquaintances from the neighborhood. Anyone who might know someone who owned a computer store or knew a businessman who was \u201cin computers.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how we began to get introduced to the early PC world in Brooklyn\u2014small storefronts, cramped back offices, people learning the business as they went along. We\u2019d bring disks, do demonstrations, talk too much, and listen carefully. Sometimes we were taken seriously. Sometimes we weren\u2019t. Sometimes we were sure we were in the middle of a real business conversation, only to realize later that we were speaking different languages\u2014not Russian and English, but \u201cengineering\u201d and \u201csales.\u201d\n\nThrough this meager chain of introductions, we eventually found our way to the Want brothers and their store in downtown Brooklyn. In those days, a computer store wasn\u2019t a sleek showroom\u2014it was more like a workshop with a cash register. Boxes stacked to the ceiling, machines in various states of assembly, printers chattering in the background, customers asking basic questions that today would seem unbelievable. The Want brothers were practical people. They understood customers. They understood what sold. And they understood immediately that what we had\u2014especially the ability to handle multiple alphabets, and right-to-left\u2014wasn\u2019t just a technical trick. For the right buyer, it was a market.\n\nOne introduction led to another. Without going into some details that were, in hindsight, almost hilarious, we stumbled into a man who decided he would build a software company around our product.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t a programmer. He wasn\u2019t even from the PC world. He was a sophisticated businessman\u2014a commodities trader\u2014who saw the opportunity before he understood the mechanics. And he was about to learn, the hard way, that early PC software wasn\u2019t like commodities. You couldn\u2019t treat it as a thing you bought and sold and expected to behave by itself. It needed engineering. It needed support. It needed constant improvement.\n\nBut in one crucial respect, he was serious: he wanted to buy the product outright.\n\n---\n\n### Selling the Product \u2014 \u201cLock, Stock and Barrel\u201d\n\nBy then, Mody Zeidman had become more than the man who co-signed my bank loan. He was the one American in our orbit who could translate this new world for us: contracts, leverage, negotiation, the quiet power of simply knowing how business is done here.\n\nMody helped us negotiate and represented us through what became a surprisingly convoluted, protracted process. There were terms, conditions, drafts, revisions, and the kind of back-and-forth that feels less like logic and more like endurance\u2014especially when you\u2019re new to the country and still learning how to read between the lines.\n\nIn the end we agreed on a deal that, even now, still feels unreal when I say it out loud.\n\nThe buyer formed a company specifically for our product and purchased it\u2014and all rights to it\u2014*lock, stock and barrel* for **$600,000**.\n\nOnly because of Mody\u2019s help did we get what I believe was a very strong price for that time. We signed the papers and walked away from our creation somewhat stunned by the size of the number. For three recent emigrants who had started from scratch, it didn\u2019t just feel like a business transaction. It felt like proof that we could build something valuable in America.\n\nTo close the loop on the word processor: the new company and product were named **World Master**. Apparently, it eventually went public\u2014I suspect on the AIM market, but I\u2019m not sure. What I do know is that it never made the progress it could have, because it didn\u2019t have software engineering support. The man who bought it didn\u2019t engage us to keep developing it. Without the people who understood the code, the product couldn\u2019t evolve the way the market demanded. In time, the company folded.\n\nSo our first product didn\u2019t become a long-term commercial success.\n\nBut for us personally, it changed everything.\n\nWe were equal partners, and each of us walked away with **$200,000**. By then it was **January 1986**\u2014in today\u2019s value, that would be over **$560,000** each. A meaningful amount of money by any standard. For three recent emigrants, it felt enormous.\n\nWe felt rich. And in the USSR we didn\u2019t know how to start a business. In America, we were about to find out\u2014fast.",

Bob Casale was very much a gentleman and supported my efforts. He and I agreed that in return for the Multex\u2019s team continued technical support of FS Partner for the next two years ADP will let us use the existing space and pay a retainer (I think of $2 millions a year) for the next two years. Obviously, this was a very generous separation agreement. Essentially Bob was giving me back my Multex System business and continuing to support it with space and a very material retainer.  I have started getting back into the business I knew well from pre-ADP days of finding clients who we can help develop technical solutions on consulting basis.  One of our first clients was a start-up in the field of medical systems. In today\u2019s terms it would be called a big data vendor. They were building a data repository that they intended to package as an information product for hospitals. Our team was building the technology for this group. Since it was a start up their financing came from a number of VCs. One of these VCs was Euclid Partners. I was doing the presentation of the technology platform we built for this client to Euclid. Euclid was represented by a young associate from, Fred Wilson. Fred was 27 or 28 years old at the time and has just started his career in the VC business. Euclid was his first VC job. As I was doing the presentation Fred, I guess, got interested by the team that was building the technology for the product and asked me what else is my team working on and if we have other products that we are working on. I was still thinking about the Merrill product idea and decided to share it with Fred. He got very excited and said that this concept is very interesting, and would we be interested in getting VC funding for this product. I said, yes, we would be interested in VC funding. That was my first introduction to VCs and the whole idea of VC based business development. I knew nothing about the whole VC concept, but this discussion started me and the Multex team in a very different direction of building a business. This was the starting point of the new Multex, the company that took seven years from the inception to an IPO in 1999, at the pick of the Internet boom of the first generation of Internet based companies and then another four years of running a public company and eventually selling it to Reuters in 2003.",

      "content": "## 11. Spin-out and the founding of Multex II\n\nBy 1989, we\u2019d done what we came to ADP to do. The deliverables were complete, FS Partner was real in the market, and my own energy was already drifting toward what came next. The separation from ADP didn\u2019t happen with a dramatic resignation or a slammed door\u2014it was gradual, practical, almost civilized.\n\nA lot of that was because of **Bob Casale**.\n\nBob was, in every sense that mattered, a gentleman. He didn\u2019t treat my desire to leave as betrayal, and he didn\u2019t try to squeeze every last ounce out of the acquisition on the way out. Instead, we worked out an arrangement that was so generous it almost didn\u2019t feel like corporate America.\n\nBob and I agreed on this: in return for the Multex team continuing to provide technical support for FS Partner for the next two years, ADP would let us keep using the existing office space and would pay us a retainer\u2014something like **$2 million a year**\u2014during that period.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just a bridge. It was a runway.\n\nIn effect, Bob was handing me back the Multex Systems business\u2014reconstituted, stabilized, and funded\u2014and giving me time to rebuild without the usual chaos that comes with starting over.\n\nSo I went back to what I knew. Pre-ADP Multex. Find clients with hard problems and build technical solutions for them on a consulting basis.\n\nOne of our first clients was a startup in the medical systems world. In today\u2019s language, you\u2019d probably call them a *big data* company. They were building a large data repository and planning to package it as an information product for hospitals. Our team built the underlying technology platform.\n\nBecause they were a startup, they were financed by venture capital. One of their VC investors was **Euclid Partners**. At some point I presented the platform we\u2019d built to Euclid\u2014part product demo, part architectural walkthrough, the kind of meeting where you\u2019re not just showing what works, you\u2019re trying to convince someone that the thing will scale and survive.\n\nEuclid\u2019s representative in the room was a young associate named **Fred Wilson**.\n\nFred was around 27 or 28 at the time, and he was just starting in venture capital. Euclid was his first VC job. He listened closely, asked sharp questions, and\u2014what stood out to me\u2014he seemed interested not only in the technology but in the people behind it.\n\nAt the end of the discussion, he asked a question that shifted the entire conversation:\n\n\u201cWhat else is your team working on? Do you have other products in mind?\u201d\n\nI still had Merrill\u2019s research distribution idea in my head\u2014the one Jim Tousignant had pushed hard, and the one I\u2019d initially dismissed as not exciting enough. But the idea hadn\u2019t gone away. It had been sitting there, quietly, like something unfinished.\n\nSo I told Fred about it: the concept of distributing financial research electronically\u2014using existing networks\u2014at a time when printing and mailing research was costing firms like Merrill tens of millions of dollars a year.\n\nFred\u2019s reaction was immediate. He leaned in.\n\nHe said the concept was not only interesting\u2014it was fundable.\n\nThen he asked the question I hadn\u2019t yet learned was a gateway drug to an entirely different life:\n\n\u201cWould you be interested in venture funding for something like that?\u201d\n\nI said yes.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain how little I understood about venture capital at that moment. I knew nothing about term sheets, valuation, preferences, boards, or what it meant to build a company designed to scale fast. But that conversation was my first real introduction to the VC world\u2014and to the idea that you could build a business around a product and finance growth with outside capital rather than consulting revenue.\n\nThat was the starting point of **Multex II**.\n\nThe \u201cnew Multex\u201d would take seven years from that early conception to an IPO in 1999\u2014at the peak of the first internet boom. Then came four years of operating as a public company. And in 2003, we sold it to **Reuters**.\n\nBut the seed of all of that\u2014IPO, public company, exit\u2014was planted in a much smaller moment: a VC associate in his first job asking what else we were building, and me realizing, almost mid-sentence, that maybe the idea I\u2019d been calling \u201cnot exciting\u201d was actually the next big thing.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can take this further in one of two ways:\n\n1) **Make the Euclid/Fred scene more cinematic** (room details, your internal thoughts, sharper dialogue, the moment you decide to mention the Merrill idea).  \n2) **Bridge this directly into the first concrete steps of Multex II** (what the product *was*, who the initial team was, how you validated demand, what Merrill/others said, early prototype decisions, etc.).\n\nWhich do you want next: more *scene*, or more *momentum into building*?",

      "content": "Multex II was a very different business than Multex I. Instead of being mainly a service business it was a product centered business. Of course, I always was dreaming about building products. The service was just a means to provide a living for myself and my employees. I didn\u2019t even know at that time about any other options of building a business. But from the first meeting with Fred, I realized that there is another way available provided you can get VCs interested in supporting your efforts. At that first meeting Fred made it sound easy, but I was just starting to learn. Realistically the entire process of raising VC money is a separate story. By the time Multex went public I got quite an education in what it really means to build a VC based business. Eventually we raised over $50 million in 5 or 6 rounds (A through F rounds if I remember correctly) and I had to pitch to and deal with a very substantial number of VCs. But I don\u2019t want this story to overdo the VC angle. I want it to be about my experience of building a product-based business and getting educated about being a businessman, a leader, an entrepreneur, all the above. Of course, along the way I\u2019ve also learned about life in America, a New York version of it, to be more precise\uf04a.  Most of my VC education was facilitated, especially initially, by Fred. Fred of course was learning the discipline himself, but he was very generous in sharing his knowledge and experience. Overtime I learned to trust him and rely on his advice and judgment. I know Fred by now close to 35 years. Almost my and his entire career. Fred is a very good friend and a colleague and of course a very successful and famous VC. But that\u2019s 35 years later.  1.\tSeries A capital raise, Euclid Partners  After our first meeting Fred introduced me to their entire firm, more importantly, to Milton Pappas, his senior partner and mentor. Over the years I got to know and appreciate Milton as well. He\u2019s from a different generation, almost my parents\u2019 generation, but along with Fred, he helped me a lot too to navigate the VC world. The first round A, that Euclid Partners, with Fred lead was one of the most difficult, as it often happens. Both Mody and I committed to invest $100K each in this round to demonstrate our personal dedication to the business. Euclid, after doing a lot of due diligence, I think finally invested $1 million. So, if I remember correctly the first round was either $1.2 or $1 million in total, with Mody and I contributing $200K and Euclid the rest. That started us on the way of building a VC based business and me personally on a journey to building and running one of the early Internet based public company.  One of the first things we did with the initial financing in our bank account, is started to look for space, since our ADP space and our contract with ADP was coming to an end.  We sublet a space in the financial district of lower Manhattan, the downtown, which from that time on for the next ten years became our favorite location for most of our New York offices. The address was 32 Maiden Lane right across from the Federal Reserve building. It was fully furnished and had space for about 50 people. At that point we had just over 20 people in the company, and I was very concerned that we are renting way too much space. But the price was very low, even by those times standards, I think $13/sq foot. So Mody convinced me to take it. It turned out to be a very smart move, since we filled out the space, I think in less than a year. But let me describe the first iteration of the product we built and went to market with. And a very interesting competitive dynamic that started from the very beginning we reached the market. 2.\tEarly prototype, Multex Net  Since the Internet wasn\u2019t available yet, the most important part of building a networking product was to build the network itself. The other challenge was to decide on the portable document format that would be used to electronically deliver the research documents. Some luck is always an important ingredient of any successful business. Multex had two very lucky things happen without which we wouldn\u2019t succeed. One big one was obviously the Internet making to the mainstream. The second the announcement and eventual proliferation of PDF as a portable document format. 3.\tProprietary IP-based distributed network architecture  When we started to build the product, we built it as a PC/Windows based user interface that through a local network connected to a server running on premises. The server itself would connect trough a frame-relay based TCP/IP wide area network to our central system. This system has run our central repository, a data base that accumulated all of the research documents contributed to us by research providers, that in turn also ran a server connected to a PC/Windows based contribution software also provided by us. So, the whole system had a two-tier star configuration, or a two-level graph. (See figure 1. tbd) We called this version of the product Multex Net, since the proprietary network was arguably the most important part of the product. Technically it worked well, but it had a few business and operational challenges. The first was the cost. In these days the cost of wide area connections was not chip. Plus, the cost of servers, routers and other telecommunication equipment was very substantial. Once it was all built out and you have enough customers it would theoretically be cost effective and provide a great moat against competition. But scaling the build out was very expensive. The other problem, also scalability related is to build out the support organization that would be responsible for equipment installation and support on client premises.  Nevertheless, with Euclid Partner\u2019s initial investment we got the system off the ground and started to install early adopters\u2019 clients on both research providers end and institutional investor clients of these research firms. Of course, the other big problem was a very typical problem for the systems of this kind where providers and consumers connect to share information. The system had to have a critical mass of both providers and consumers to be interesting and cost effective to both sides of the equation. And we had to convince both sides that we will be able to do it. The interesting business dynamic was that in our case competition was one of the most important factors that eventually made us successful.  At that time there was only one company in the market that offered a solution somewhat like what we were attempting to do. The company was called First Call and was part of another large financial information provider Thomson Financial. Their technology was very inferior and limited. It was only delivering a small subset of research, called morning notes in a textual format through a broadcast system. It would deliver a broadcast of the text snippets that the research organizations would contribute in the morning to First Call. Once delivered information would not be able to be changed or reviewed historically. And of course, the morning notes were just a small subset of research produced by the firms. But First Call was unique in offering this electronic stream of research. It was in essence a research newswire. And because it was a monopoly it has benefited from this position enormously. First Call charged both contributors of research notes and consumers of it a very high price for the access to the system. And both sides, very powerful financial institutions, hated to be beholden to this company that acted as an arrogant monopoly.  That\u2019s why when we appeared on the horizon the same firms were very interested in making sure that we can succeed. The market desperately wanted to have a legitimate competitor to First Call. So, our entrance into the market was generally cheered and supported by both sides Investment Banks and brokerages, producers of research \u2013 the sell-side and the Investment Management firms, the consumers of research \u2013 the buy-side.  This competitive dynamic was very helpful all along, throughout our existence, as the market always viewed us the technologically advanced, nimble and flexible, overall, the \u201cgood guys\u201d and First Call as retrograde and inflexible, the \u201cbad guys\u201d. Nevertheless, the competition with a very large, financially powerful competitor was never easy and at times they almost managed to kill us, but not quite. One of the most interesting moments happened about two years into our existence. Here\u2019s how it started. 4.\tAdobe and announcement of PDF  We first ran into First Call at the Adobe announcement of PDF. It was the summer of 1993. The announcement was held in New York, in one of the big hotels. At that point we already had an early version of Multex Net running. At least sufficiently enough to demonstrate the capabilities. Jim somehow got us invited to present, along with Dr. John Warnock co-founder of Adobe, as one of the early adopters of the PDF technology. We used an early beta version of the PDF reader in our product. Sitting in the audience, not far from me was the CTO of First call along with a few of his colleagues. They paid close attention to our presentation and got quite concerned that we might be encroaching on their turf. Shortly after that we discovered that First Call is working on a product that will provide functionality directly competitive to ours. About a year or so later, as we were making some early progress in the market, we already had a few contributors of research and a few institutional investors users. These were big firms and our early supporters/adopters. On the sell-side we had Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs, on the buy side we T. Rowe Price, Prudential, and a few others. 5.\tFidelity acquisition offer derailed by First Call  Fidelity Investment was very interested in our product as well. And as one of the more advanced technologically firms, and one of the most acquisitive in the technology field, they started to consider an acquisition of Multex. At that point we mostly ran through our first investment round and were considering what our next step would be. The Fidelity offer was very timely and quite interesting financially for me personally. They offered $20 millions for the company and to provide us with continuing funding and resources to continue to develop the product. Given the influence Fidelity had (and still has) in the market our most difficult task of getting the sell-side firms to contribute their research would become no issue to us. And with critical mass of content provided by the sell-side the value of our product to the buy-side would increase dramatically. Also, since we were still running on a proprietary network and needed a lot of funding to roll it out, the financial backing of Fidelity was very critical. Not to mention that I personally would do quite well, as I still owed a great majority of the equity. We went through extensive due diligence, met with the senior management of Fidelity, including Ned Johnson, the CEO of Fidelity at that time. Everything looked good. In fact, we were just a day from signing the definitive agreement. And that when we got a notification that First Call started a patent case against us claiming \u201cprior art\u201d in their technology versus ours. As it eventually turned out it was completely bogus. We most definitely had \u201cprior art\u201d since First Call didn\u2019t even have a product when we already were publicly demonstrating ours. But the filing of the case was sufficient to scare off Fidelity. The deal was neve consummated and we had basically no funds to continue our development.  We were very close to shutting the company. Fred and I started busily contacting potential investors. One thing that was life saving for us at that point is that we have completed a deal with Bloomberg Financial to become a redistributor of our research data base to their customers. We already had a deal like this signed with Reuters and adding the other major market data vendor was very important, although financially neither of the deals had materially contributed to our revenue. 6.\tSeries B capital raise   We finally managed to pull together the round. The main new investor was AT&T Ventures and the partner that led the investment and became the board member was Alessandro Piol. I don\u2019t remember if we had any other investors in that round, outside of Euclid partners continuing to invest. But with this round completed we were able to continue operations.  7.\tSubsequent raises, Softbank, Chase Capital  Over the next year or two we raised additional capital from Softbank and Chase Ventures. Softbank is of course a very famous investment house, but at that point it was much smaller. It was represented by Charley Lax, who was also on the company\u2019s board. Even though investment in Multex wasn\u2019t one of their famous mega investments, as one of the portfolio companies I met several of their partners and executives, including the famous Mr. Masayoshi Son. Although that happened much later, once we were a public company and I was in Japan for the opening of Multex Investor Japan, a joint Venture with Reuters. Chase ventures was represented by Bob Greene, who also joined our board of directors. At this point the combined VCs had a majority control of the equity in the company, so their influence on the business and technical direction of the company became very important.  8.\tDiverting interest of VCs and founders  One key event I remember that happened around that time, sometime in the middle of 1995, is a discussion, more like a heated debate, at one of the board meetings. Since the first version of our product was built around 1993 when Internet and the browser were not such a common place as it shortly became, even though we used a TCP/IP network it was built around a proprietary frame-relay network which guaranteed delivery and throughput but was very expensive. To build it out we would need a lot of investments. And obviously the excitement around that time started to reach a very high level, as it normally happens when a new technology trend becomes popular. VCs are the first to get excited. So obviously all my VCs where advocating very aggressively for us to migrate to Internet delivery instead of using a proprietary private network. Even though I was equally excited about the promises of the Internet I also realized that with the prevalent then dial-up speed of most of the Internet connections and the corporate world being very reluctant and cautions to adopt an \u201cinsecure and very slow Internet\u201d we would have major challenges to get Multex Net to reliably work over Internet. Finally given the primitive capabilities of the first iterations of the browsers our chances with our corporate clients to use the Internet in the real world to deliver a robust are information heavy product are very slim, if any.  But the VCs were adamant to a point of intimating that if I won\u2019t agree they\u2019ll fire me as the CEO. The debate went back and forth for a few months, but eventually we settled on a compromise that we\u2019ll implement an Internet/browser-based version of the product but will continue to offer to the clients both a dedicated network and an Internet version.  We operated that way for a little while, but the speed of adaption of the Internet surprised us all and before too long the only version of the product we were offering was the Internet/browser-based version. Nevertheless, we also had a group of users who loved the dynamic interface of the older version and we even had to migrate the proprietary interface to the Internet, so we had an internet connected version, but with an active desk-top front end. Now days this type of application is quite common, and a lot of popular applications have a browser version, as well as a \u201cnative\u201d desk-top app. Our approach then proved to be very forward looking. Obviously, the Internet changed a lot of things for us. 1) Cost, 2) Support, 3) Excitement and acceptance, 4) Internet .com company, 5) ability to IPO First the pricing structure for our service became very different. Instead of having to pay for infrastructure, operations, etc. most of our costs just magically disappeared. Assuming the clients had a decent Internet connection all they have to do to access our services was to point their browsers to our URL. Our cost was essentially zero.  The cost of support and operations on our side was very much reduces and become just a small fraction of what it was when we had to support and operate a proprietary infrastructure.  The excitement of the Internet and the opportunities it represented was at such a peach that any company considered to be an \u201cInternet company\u201d with a \u201c.com\u201d in the name was golden. 9.\tInternet bubble   Suddenly, several young Internet companies started to go public. Netscape IPO-d on August 9, 1995, just a year after being founded. This was really the beginning of the Internet bubble. I don\u2019t think Netscape had any meaningful revenue at that point. So, if the company had \u201c.com\u201d in its name it didn\u2019t matter if it had a reasonable business model or even plan. A ton of companies that didn\u2019t have right to even be funded, went public. Naturally we were swept by the excitement. At that point, in 1998/99 we had already established a reasonable name recognition in the industry and reached a revenue of approximately $20 million. We were not yet profitable, but were growing at a good rate, probably close to 100% annually. Compared to a number of so-called Internet companies at that time we were a reasonable candidate for an IPO in a year or two. But because of the excitement and the pressure from investors we decided to use the momentum and go public while the market is hot. And of course, it was super-hot.  10.\tBuilding up to the IPO  Because our market was what today would be called FinTech, but at that time was a \u201cvertical\u201d market as appose to a consumer market, fashionable at that time, we were not considered the most favorable IPO candidate. Nevertheless, all investment banking houses were eager to take a hold of a potential IPO target and busily courted us too. Eventually we selected three to prepare us for an IPO. The three were in order of priority: Robertson Stephens, San Francisco based specialty investment bank, CIBC Oppenheimer, New York based IB, Dain Rauscher Wessels, Midwest based IB.  Even though I ran the business by that time for over four years and raised a fair amount of VC capital, I still was na\u00efve about the whole idea of IPO and the process of it. Some of my VC investors suggested a private instructor to educate me about the IPO process. It was a very good and interesting experience. My coach was a lady in her 60-ties. And she smoked like a chimney. But she was very good, and I learned a fair amount from her. She went close shopping with me, tried to teach me to be comfortable in front of an audience, make a concise and to the point presentation and a bunch of other things quite useful for a CEO. Overall, I have a very fond memory of my preparation to the road show.",

      "content": "Here are some ways to sharpen this chapter while keeping your intent (product-building and personal education) front and center, plus a few \u201cdrop-in\u201d rewrites for key moments.\n\n## Big-picture narrative improvements (without \u201coverdoing\u201d VC)\n### 1) Establish a clear spine for the chapter\nRight now it reads like a rich set of memories (which is good), but the reader needs a simple through-line. A clean spine could be:\n\n**Multex II = product company \u2192 needs capital and scale \u2192 network/PDF/Internet inflection \u2192 competition forces adoption \u2192 near-death moment (Fidelity derailed) \u2192 B round lifeline \u2192 board power shift \u2192 Internet pivot \u2192 bubble \u2192 IPO runway.**\n\nYou can reinforce the spine by adding **1\u20132 sentence \u201cchapter signposts\u201d** at transitions:\n- \u201cThis was my first lesson: money changes the company, and it changes you.\u201d\n- \u201cThe second lesson: technology doesn\u2019t win alone\u2014distribution and market structure do.\u201d\n- \u201cThe third lesson: your board doesn\u2019t \u2018advise\u2019 in a crunch; it decides.\u201d\n\n### 2) Make the \u201cproduct\u201d feel tangible sooner\nYou talk about architecture, but we don\u2019t yet *feel* what a user experienced. Add one short paragraph early in \u201cMultex Net\u201d like:\n- What the buy-side user saw at 6:30am.\n- How research arrived, how it was organized, why it was better than fax/First Call.\n- A tiny \u201cday in the life\u201d moment makes the system real.\n\n### 3) Turn a few parts into scenes (not summaries)\nPick 3 \u201cscene anchors\u201d and dramatize them with a room, a line of dialogue, and stakes:\n- **The Maiden Lane decision** (your fear vs. Mody\u2019s conviction).\n- **Adobe PDF event** (you spot First Call CTO watching).\n- **Fidelity deal collapsing** (the day-before-signing whiplash).\n- Optional fourth: **the board showdown about Internet**.\n\nEverything else can stay summarized.\n\n### 4) Clarify the cast (and keep names from blurring)\nYou introduce many names fast. A light trick: **re-attach roles** the second time they appear:\n- \u201cFred (still learning VC himself, but ahead of me by two turns)\u2026\u201d\n- \u201cMilton Pappas, Fred\u2019s senior partner\u2014older, quieter, the kind of authority you don\u2019t question.\u201d\n\n### 5) Tighten the tech sections to \u201cwhy it mattered\u201d\nYour architecture description is strong but could be trimmed by 25\u201340% and tied more explicitly to consequences:\n- expensive to scale\n- hard to install/support\n- created moat *if* you survived long enough\nThat keeps the reader oriented even if they aren\u2019t technical.\n\n---\n\n## Suggested rewrite snippets (in your voice)\n\n### A) Opening: \u201cMultex II is different\u201d (cleaner, more confident)\n**Original idea is good; this version trims repetition and tees up the real theme.**\n\n> Multex II was a very different business than Multex I. Multex I was a services company dressed up as a technology company\u2014because that was the only way I knew to build something. We sold our time so we could afford to keep experimenting.  \n>   \n> Multex II was the opposite: a product company that needed capital before it could earn it. Until I met Fred, I didn\u2019t even fully understand that this was a legitimate path. He made it sound simple\u2014find investors, raise money, build fast. I was about to learn that raising venture capital isn\u2019t a transaction; it\u2019s a relationship, and eventually it becomes a form of governance.  \n>   \n> I don\u2019t want this story to turn into a venture-capital memoir. The real story is what it did to me: how building a product company educated me\u2014about markets, leadership, negotiation, ego, fear, and the peculiar New York flavor of American business.\n\n### B) Series A: make it feel like a leap (and a personal stake)\n> The first round was the hardest. It always is, because you\u2019re asking strangers to fund a future that only exists in your head. Mody and I each committed $100,000\u2014real money for us\u2014because we needed everyone to know we weren\u2019t playing entrepreneur. We were betting our lives.  \n>   \n> Euclid did what good investors do: slow, skeptical, thorough. And then, finally, they said yes. I believe Euclid invested $1 million, and with our $200,000 the round came to roughly $1.2 million. It wasn\u2019t a fortune. But it was enough to become dangerous\u2014to ourselves and to our competitors.\n\n### C) 32 Maiden Lane: turn it into a small scene\n> One of the first things we did with the money was look for office space. Our ADP arrangement was ending, and we needed a home that felt like *our* company.  \n>   \n> We found a sublet at **32 Maiden Lane**, across from the Federal Reserve. It was fully furnished and built for fifty people. We had a little over twenty.  \n>   \n> I remember walking the floor and doing the math in my head like an immigrant father balancing a checkbook. Fifty seats. Twenty people. Rent. Phones. Heat. It felt reckless.  \n>   \n> Mody looked at me and said, essentially, *\u201cIf we\u2019re building a product company, we\u2019d better start acting like one.\u201d*  \n>   \n> The price was $13 a square foot\u2014almost insulting even then. I agreed, still uneasy. We filled the space in less than a year.\n\n### D) Multex Net: reduce the diagram tone, add business meaning\n> Before the Internet became a utility, \u201cnetworking product\u201d meant you literally had to build the network. Multex Net was a two-sided system: research providers on one end, institutional investors on the other, and us in the middle\u2014collecting, normalizing, and redistributing research at a scale that used to require armies of fax machines.  \n>   \n> Technically it worked. Business-wise it was heavy. Wide-area connectivity was expensive. Hardware was expensive. And every new customer implied a new installation and a new support burden. If we got to scale, the infrastructure could become a moat. But first we had to survive the cost of building it.\n\n### E) First Call: sharpen the \u201cgood guys vs bad guys\u201d dynamic\n> First Call wasn\u2019t just a competitor. It was a monopoly with the habits monopolies develop: high prices, limited innovation, and a tone that suggested customers should be grateful.  \n>   \n> The market\u2019s reaction to us surprised me. The big firms\u2014both sell-side and buy-side\u2014weren\u2019t merely curious. They *wanted* a credible alternative to exist. In finance, powerful institutions rarely agree on anything. But they agreed on this: nobody liked being trapped.\n\n### F) Adobe PDF event: add a cinematic moment\n> We ran into First Call in an unlikely place: an Adobe event in the summer of 1993. PDF was being introduced to the world like a new alphabet.  \n>   \n> Jim somehow got us invited to present. There we were\u2014still a young company, still fragile\u2014showing our system with an early beta PDF reader embedded into the workflow.  \n>   \n> In the audience, not far from me, sat First Call\u2019s CTO with a few colleagues. They weren\u2019t chatting. They weren\u2019t smiling. They watched the screen the way a homeowner watches a stranger test the front door.  \n>   \n> That day I learned a quiet rule: when you demonstrate a product publicly, you\u2019re not only marketing. You\u2019re also declaring war\u2014sometimes before you know you are.\n\n### G) Fidelity deal collapse: make it the chapter\u2019s \u201cgut punch\u201d\n> Fidelity moved fast. They were technologically sophisticated, operationally disciplined, and\u2014most important\u2014capable of making the sell-side cooperate. Their offer was **$20 million**, plus continued funding to build the product properly.  \n>   \n> For me personally it was life-changing. For the company it was oxygen and legitimacy. We went through diligence, met senior management, even met **Ned Johnson**. It felt real.  \n>   \n> We were a day from signing the definitive agreement when the message came: First Call had filed a patent case claiming prior art.  \n>   \n> Later it became clear it was bogus. But it didn\u2019t need to be valid to be effective. It only needed to be expensive and uncertain.  \n>   \n> Fidelity walked.  \n>   \n> The whiplash was physical. One day you\u2019re imagining what you\u2019ll build with resources. The next day you\u2019re calculating how many payrolls you can make before the lights go out.\n\n### H) Board \u201cInternet pivot\u201d fight: show power shift without villainizing\nYou already have great material here. I\u2019d just add one line to make the subtext explicit:\n\n> By then, the VCs collectively had control. That\u2019s the part founders don\u2019t fully understand at the beginning: you think you\u2019re raising money; you\u2019re also selling votes.\n\nAnd then turn the ultimatum into a clean, memorable moment:\n> The message\u2014never said in exactly these words, but unmistakable\u2014was: *pivot or be replaced.*\n\n---\n\n## Structural suggestion: break into short titled subsections\nYour numbered outline is good; you can make it read more like a narrative chapter by using headings that carry emotion:\n\n1. **\u201cReal Money, Real Rules\u201d** (Series A / Milton / Fred)  \n2. **\u201cMaiden Lane\u201d** (space + early momentum)  \n3. **\u201cWe Had to Build the Network\u201d** (Multex Net)  \n4. **\u201cThe Market Wanted a Second Player\u201d** (First Call dynamic)  \n5. **\u201cPDF: A Format That Changed Everything\u201d** (Adobe scene)  \n6. **\u201cThe Deal That Almost Saved Us\u201d** (Fidelity + patent ambush)  \n7. **\u201cLifeline\u201d** (Series B + Bloomberg/Reuters mention)  \n8. **\u201cWhen Investors Start Steering\u201d** (Internet debate)  \n9. **\u201cBubble Weather\u201d** (Netscape, .com gold, your metrics)  \n10. **\u201cIPO Training\u201d** (coach vignette)\n\n---\n\n## Quick line edits (small but high impact)\n- \u201cwasn\u2019t available yet\u201d \u2192 \u201cwasn\u2019t a utility yet\u201d (more accurate; Internet existed)\n- \u201cchip\u201d \u2192 \u201ccheap\u201d\n- \u201ctough a frame-relay\u201d \u2192 \u201cthrough\u201d\n- \u201cpeach\u201d \u2192 \u201cpitch\u201d or \u201cpeak\u201d\n- \u201cas appose\u201d \u2192 \u201cas opposed\u201d\n- \u201cneve consummated\u201d \u2192 \u201cnever consummated\u201d\n- \u201csuper-hot\u201d works\u2014keep it; it\u2019s your voice.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can take your full text and do a **single-pass rewrite** that:\n1) keeps every fact you mention,  \n2) improves flow and grammar,  \n3) converts the 3\u20134 key moments into scenes,  \n4) preserves your voice (immigrant-founder, pragmatic, reflective).  \n\nTell me whether you want the rewrite to be **memoir-clean and polished** or **more raw and conversational** like spoken recollection.",

      "content": "### Multex II\n\nMultex II was a very different business than Multex I. Multex I was, at its core, a services company. The \u201cservice\u201d was a way to make a living\u2014for me and for the people who depended on the company for a paycheck\u2014while I kept trying to build something more scalable. I had always dreamed about building products, but in those early years I didn\u2019t really know a practical path to do it. I assumed you either had revenue or you didn\u2019t have a business.\n\nFrom my first meeting with Fred, I realized there was another path\u2014if you could get venture capitalists interested enough to fund the effort. Fred made it sound straightforward. I was just beginning to learn what the process actually involves and how much of it is its own discipline. By the time Multex went public, I had a full education in what it really means to build a VC-backed company. We ultimately raised more than $50 million across multiple rounds\u2014A through F, if I remember correctly\u2014and I pitched and negotiated with a large number of investors along the way.\n\nBut I don\u2019t want this story to become a venture-capital memoir. The real story is my experience of building a product business, and how that experience educated me\u2014about leadership, markets, decision-making, and what it means to be a businessman and an entrepreneur. Along the way, it also taught me about life in America\u2014New York\u2019s version of it, to be more precise.\n\nA lot of my early \u201cVC education\u201d was facilitated by Fred. He was learning the discipline himself, but he was generous in sharing what he knew and what he was observing. Over time, I learned to trust him and to rely on his advice and judgment. I have now known Fred for almost 35 years\u2014nearly the span of both our careers. Today he is a close friend, a colleague, and, of course, a very successful and famous VC. But that\u2019s 35 years later. In the early days, he was simply the person who helped me understand how this world worked.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Series A: Euclid Partners\n\nAfter our first meeting, Fred introduced me to the firm and, more importantly, to Milton Pappas\u2014his senior partner and mentor. Milton was from a different generation, almost my parents\u2019 generation, but over the years I came to know and appreciate him. In his own way, and alongside Fred, he helped me navigate the venture world: how investors think, what questions matter, and what \u201csupport\u201d really means once money is on the table.\n\nThe first round\u2014Series A, led by Euclid Partners\u2014was one of the most difficult, as it often is. Mody and I each committed $100,000 to demonstrate personal conviction and alignment. Euclid, after substantial due diligence, invested about $1 million. So, if I remember correctly, the round was roughly $1.2 million total: $200,000 from Mody and me, and the rest from Euclid.\n\nThat financing started us down two paths at once: Multex\u2019s path toward becoming a venture-backed company, and my personal path toward learning how to build and run a product-based business at scale.\n\nOne of the first practical things we did\u2014once the money was actually in the bank\u2014was look for office space. Our time at ADP was coming to an end, and our contract with them was expiring. We needed a home of our own.\n\nWe found a sublet in the financial district: **32 Maiden Lane**, directly across from the Federal Reserve. It was fully furnished and had room for about 50 people. At the time, we had just over 20. My first reaction was anxiety. It felt like too much space, too much commitment, and too much overhead for a company still finding its footing.\n\nBut the price was very low even by the standards of that era\u2014about $13 per square foot\u2014and Mody convinced me to take it. It turned out to be a very smart decision. We filled that space, I think, in less than a year. And from that point on, downtown Manhattan became our preferred home for much of the next decade.\n\nWith the company housed and funded, we could focus fully on the product.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Early prototype: Multex Net\n\nIn the early 1990s, before the Internet became mainstream, a \u201cnetworking product\u201d often meant you had to build the network itself. We also had to choose a portable document format robust enough for electronic delivery of research documents.\n\nLuck is always part of any successful business. Multex benefited from two pieces of luck without which we might not have succeeded at all. The first was the Internet eventually becoming a mainstream utility. The second was the announcement\u2014and then the rapid proliferation\u2014of **PDF** as a portable document format.\n\nBefore either of those forces fully played out, we built an early system that we called **Multex Net**, because the proprietary network was arguably the most important part of the product.\n\n---\n\n## 3. A proprietary, IP-based distributed network architecture\n\nThe first iteration of Multex Net was designed as a Windows/PC user interface running on the client desktop, connected through a local network to an on-premises server. That server connected via a frame-relay based TCP/IP wide area network to our central system. Our central system maintained a repository and database of research documents. On the contributor side, research providers ran a server that connected to a Windows/PC-based contribution application we supplied. In effect, the system had a two-tier star configuration\u2014a two-level graph.\n\nTechnically, it worked well. Business-wise and operationally, it came with serious challenges.\n\nFirst, it was expensive. Wide-area connectivity was not cheap in those days, and the cost of servers, routers, and telecom equipment added up quickly. If you managed to build enough scale, the economics could become compelling\u2014and the network could become a meaningful moat. But getting to that point required substantial capital.\n\nSecond, it created a support and deployment burden. We needed people who could install and support equipment at client sites. Scaling that kind of field operation is always hard.\n\nNevertheless, with Euclid\u2019s initial investment, we got the system off the ground and began installing early adopter clients on both ends: research providers and institutional investors. Naturally, this introduced another classic problem of two-sided networks: you need a critical mass of providers and consumers for either side to see value. And you have to convince both sides you can get there.\n\nIn our case, one factor helped more than anything else: competition.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The market\u2019s appetite for a competitor: First Call\n\nAt that time there was essentially one company offering something in the same direction: **First Call**, part of **Thomson Financial**. Their technology was inferior and limited. They delivered only a subset of research\u2014\u201cmorning notes\u201d\u2014in text format, via a broadcast system. Once delivered, the information could not be easily changed, and it was not searchable historically. It was, in essence, a research newswire.\n\nBut First Call was unique in offering any electronic stream of research at all, and because it was effectively a monopoly, it benefited enormously. It charged both contributors and consumers high prices, and both sides\u2014powerful institutions on the sell-side and the buy-side\u2014hated being beholden to an arrogant monopoly.\n\nThat\u2019s why our appearance on the horizon created an unusually supportive reaction. The market wanted a legitimate competitor. Both investment banks and brokerages (the producers of research, the sell-side) and investment management firms (the consumers, the buy-side) wanted a second player to exist.\n\nThroughout our existence, this dynamic helped us. The market generally perceived us as the technologically advanced, nimble, flexible \u201cgood guys,\u201d and First Call as the retrograde, inflexible \u201cbad guys.\u201d But competing with a large, financially powerful incumbent was never easy. At times they nearly killed us.\n\nOne of the most important episodes began in the summer of 1993.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Adobe and the announcement of PDF\n\nWe first ran into First Call directly at the Adobe announcement of PDF, held in New York in one of the big hotels. By then, we already had an early version of Multex Net running\u2014at least good enough to demonstrate.\n\nJim somehow got us invited to present as one of the early adopters of PDF technology, alongside **Dr. John Warnock**, Adobe\u2019s co-founder. We used an early beta version of the PDF reader in our product.\n\nSitting in the audience, not far from me, was the CTO of First Call with several colleagues. They watched our presentation closely. It was obvious they were concerned we were moving into their territory.\n\nShortly afterward we learned that First Call was working on a product that would compete directly with ours.\n\nAbout a year later, as we started to make early progress, we had major firms adopting on both sides. On the sell-side, we had Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs. On the buy-side, we had T. Rowe Price, Prudential, and several others. We were still early, still fragile\u2014but clearly no longer theoretical.\n\nThat\u2019s when Fidelity entered the picture.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Fidelity\u2019s acquisition offer\u2014and how it was derailed\n\nFidelity Investments was very interested in our product. They were one of the more technologically advanced firms in the industry and also one of the more acquisitive. They began to consider acquiring Multex.\n\nThe timing was perfect and, for me personally, compelling. Fidelity offered **$20 million** for the company and proposed to continue funding and resourcing the development of the product. Given Fidelity\u2019s influence, our hardest problem\u2014getting the sell-side firms to contribute research\u2014would become much easier. With enough content from the sell-side, the value to the buy-side would increase dramatically. And because we were still dependent on a proprietary network and needed significant capital to roll it out, Fidelity\u2019s backing mattered.\n\nWe went through extensive due diligence. We met Fidelity\u2019s senior management, including **Ned Johnson**, who was the CEO at the time. Everything looked good. In fact, we were one day away from signing the definitive agreement.\n\nThen we received notice that First Call had filed a patent case against us, claiming \u201cprior art\u201d in their technology versus ours.\n\nAs it eventually became clear, the claim was baseless. First Call did not even have a comparable product when we were already publicly demonstrating ours. But the lawsuit didn\u2019t have to be right to be effective. It only needed to introduce uncertainty and risk.\n\nFidelity walked away. The deal was never consummated. And suddenly we had almost no funds to continue development.\n\nWe were very close to shutting the company down.\n\nFred and I immediately began contacting potential investors. One thing that helped keep us credible during that period was that we had completed a deal with Bloomberg Financial to redistribute our research database to their customers. We had a similar agreement with Reuters already. While neither deal materially contributed to revenue at that stage, having both of the major market data vendors aligned with us mattered.\n\nEventually, we put together the next round.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Series B: a lifeline\n\nWe managed to close a Series B round. The main new investor was **AT&T Ventures**, and the partner who led the investment and joined our board was **Alessandro Piol**. I don\u2019t recall whether there were other new investors beyond Euclid continuing to participate, but that round allowed us to keep operating and keep building.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Subsequent raises: Softbank, Chase Capital\u2014and the changing balance of power\n\nOver the next year or two, we raised additional capital from **Softbank** and **Chase Ventures**.\n\nSoftbank was represented by **Charley Lax**, who joined our board. Softbank is famous today, but at that time it was much smaller. Through the relationship, I met several of their partners and executives, including **Masayoshi Son**\u2014though that happened later, after we were public, when I traveled to Japan for the opening of Multex Investor Japan, a joint venture with Reuters.\n\nChase Ventures was represented by **Bob Greene**, who also joined our board.\n\nBy this stage, the combined VCs held majority control of the equity, and their influence over the strategic and technical direction of the company became material. This was another lesson I had to learn: raising capital is not only about cash\u2014it is also about governance.\n\nAround the middle of 1995, this became impossible to ignore.\n\n---\n\n## 9. The Internet pivot: founder instinct versus investor urgency\n\nSometime in mid-1995, we had a board meeting that turned into a heated debate. Our product architecture had been designed in 1993, before browsers and consumer Internet access were commonplace. Even though we were using TCP/IP, we were delivering over a proprietary frame-relay network that guaranteed delivery and throughput\u2014but was expensive.\n\nTo continue building and scaling that proprietary network would require significant investment. At the same time, excitement about the Internet was accelerating quickly. Venture capitalists are often the first to get excited, and my investors were no exception. They advocated aggressively that we migrate to Internet delivery rather than continue building a private network.\n\nI was excited too, but I was also wary. Dial-up speeds were slow. Corporate security teams were cautious, sometimes paranoid. Browsers were primitive. I worried that we would lose reliability and the user experience, and that we would damage trust with the very clients we were trying to win.\n\nThe VCs were adamant\u2014so adamant that the conversation included the implicit message every founder eventually learns to recognize: if you refuse, you can be replaced.\n\nThe debate went on for months. Eventually we reached a compromise: we would build an Internet/browser-based version of the product while continuing to offer a dedicated network option for clients who needed it.\n\nIn practice, the Internet adoption curve surprised all of us. Before long, the only version we were selling was the browser-based one. Still, some users loved the more dynamic interface of the original system, and we eventually migrated that experience to an Internet-connected version with an active desktop front end. Today it\u2019s common to have both a browser version and a native desktop app. At the time, it was forward-looking\u2014and it helped us.\n\nThe Internet changed almost everything about our business:\n\n1. **Cost structure:** If clients had decent Internet access, they could reach us simply by going to a URL. Many infrastructure costs that had been fundamental to Multex Net effectively vanished.  \n2. **Support and operations:** We no longer had to install and support as much hardware on client premises. Our operational burden dropped dramatically.  \n3. **Market excitement and acceptance:** Being perceived as an \u201cInternet company\u201d became a tailwind in itself.  \n4. **IPO feasibility:** The Internet created not just a technical platform, but a capital-market moment.\n\nThat moment soon became a mania.\n\n---\n\n## 10. The Internet bubble and the road to the IPO\n\nNetscape went public on August 9, 1995, barely a year after being founded. That IPO was a signal flare. It marked the beginning of what became the Internet bubble.\n\nSuddenly, companies with \u201c.com\u201d in the name were treated as if the business model didn\u2019t matter. Many that had no right even to be funded went public. We were swept up in that excitement too.\n\nBy 1998\u20131999, we had built real industry recognition and reached approximately **$20 million** in revenue. We were not yet profitable, but we were growing quickly\u2014close to 100% annually. Compared to many \u201cInternet companies\u201d going public at the time, we were a serious business.\n\nBecause our market was what would now be called FinTech\u2014then described more as a \u201cvertical\u201d market rather than a consumer phenomenon\u2014we were not the most fashionable IPO candidate. But investment banks were eager to win mandates, and we were courted heavily.\n\nEventually we selected three to prepare us for an IPO, in order of priority:\n1. **Robertson Stephens** (San Francisco-based specialty investment bank)  \n2. **CIBC Oppenheimer** (New York-based)  \n3. **Dain Rauscher Wessels** (Midwest-based)\n\nEven though I had run the business for more than four years by then and raised multiple rounds of capital, I was still na\u00efve about what an IPO truly demands. One of my VC investors suggested I hire a private coach to prepare me for the roadshow.\n\nIt turned out to be an excellent idea.\n\nMy coach was a woman in her sixties who smoked like a chimney. She was tough, direct, and highly effective. She took me clothes shopping, taught me how to stand and speak with confidence, how to stay concise, how to answer questions without wandering, and how to project credibility in a room full of skeptics whose job was to find weakness.\n\nI remember that period with genuine fondness. I was preparing to present Multex to the public markets\u2014but in a deeper sense, I was preparing to become a different kind of CEO than the one who had started by selling services just to keep the lights on.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can do the same \u201cmemoir-clean\u201d pass on the next section (IPO execution/roadshow/pricing/first day trading), and I can also propose where to insert the \u201cFigure 1\u201d so it supports the story rather than interrupting it.",

      "content": "A few different things can be true at the same time: Multex \u201cfailed\u201d in the sense that it did not remain an independent, enduring public company; but it also \u201csucceeded\u201d in building a real product business, reaching meaningful scale, and becoming valuable enough to be acquired. What happened\u2014and why it didn\u2019t last as a standalone company\u2014usually comes down to a combination of market timing, dependence on external platforms/customers, and what the post-bubble public markets demanded.\n\nSince you\u2019re asking generally, here are the most plausible (and memoir-useful) causes to frame it. If you confirm the actual endpoint (acquired by Reuters? folded into Thomson/First Call? delisted? bankrupt?), I can tailor this to the exact facts.\n\n## What happened (typical Multex arc)\n1. **Rapid growth into the late-1990s bubble.**  \n   The Internet transition lowered distribution costs and increased adoption, and the market rewarded \u201cInternet-enabled\u201d infrastructure companies with high valuations.\n\n2. **IPO momentum met a new reality post-2000.**  \n   After the bubble broke, public investors stopped paying for growth alone and started demanding profitability, predictability, and defensible margins.\n\n3. **Industry consolidation accelerated.**  \n   Financial information is a scale game. Big incumbents (Reuters, Thomson, Bloomberg) already owned distribution, enterprise contracts, and workflows. Over time they tend to absorb point solutions\u2014even good ones\u2014because customers prefer fewer vendors and integrated platforms.\n\n4. **Multex became strategically valuable, but strategically exposed.**  \n   If your content came from sell-side contributors and your users were buy-side institutions, then you were in the middle of two powerful constituencies. That position is valuable, but it also means:\n   - contributors can threaten to withhold content or demand better economics,\n   - big distributors can replicate features or squeeze you on distribution,\n   - customers can use you as leverage in pricing negotiations with bigger vendors.\n\nThat combination often ends not with a dramatic \u201cfailure,\u201d but with a forced choice: **sell, merge, or get slowly compressed.**\n\n## Why it failed (root causes that make sense in a memoir)\n### 1) The moat moved: infrastructure advantage became temporary\nMultex Net\u2019s early moat was partly technical (network + delivery). Once the Internet became the standard transport and PDF became ubiquitous, **delivery stopped being scarce**. The advantage shifted from \u201cwe can deliver it\u201d to:\n- \u201cwe own the workflow\u201d\n- \u201cwe own the desktop\u201d\n- \u201cwe bundle it with terminals/data\u201d\nThat favored Bloomberg/Reuters/Thomson.\n\n### 2) Two-sided marketplace dynamics never fully go away\nEven with scale, you\u2019re always balancing:\n- sell-side economics and compliance concerns,\n- buy-side willingness to pay,\n- and the platform in the middle trying to capture value.\nIf either side sees you as replaceable\u2014or sees your fees as a tax\u2014they push back hard.\n\n### 3) The public markets changed what \u201cgood\u201d looked like\nPost-bubble, a $20M revenue company growing fast but still investing heavily could be punished. If the market demands profitability and you still need to spend to:\n- acquire/retain content partners,\n- build product features to keep up with platforms,\n- support enterprise clients,\nthen you can get trapped: **cut costs and stall growth, or spend and miss earnings**.\n\n### 4) Distribution is destiny in financial information\nEven if the product is better, incumbents have:\n- existing enterprise relationships,\n- procurement leverage,\n- bundled pricing,\n- and default presence on the trader/investor desktop.\nA standalone product company can win\u2014briefly\u2014but long-term independence is hard unless you become the platform.\n\n### 5) Competitive pressure can turn from \u201ctailwind\u201d to \u201cgravity\u201d\nEarly on, the market wanted you to exist to discipline First Call\u2019s pricing\u2014so they supported you. But once you became established, those same institutions had incentives to:\n- commoditize the service,\n- negotiate pricing down,\n- treat you as interchangeable infrastructure.\n\n## The most compelling way to tell it in Multex II\nFor memoir purposes, the cleanest framing is not \u201cwe failed,\u201d but:\n\n> \u201cWe built something real, but the industry we served rewards scale and integration more than it rewards standalone innovation.\u201d\n\nThat lets you keep the dignity of the accomplishment while still explaining the outcome.\n\n## Two quick questions so I can write the exact \u201cwhat happened\u201d section accurately\n1) What was the final outcome you want to describe\u2014**acquisition (by whom?), merger, bankruptcy, delisting, or shutdown**?  \n2) When did you stop being CEO / when did you exit relative to that outcome?\n\nIf you answer those, I\u2019ll draft a memoir-clean section titled something like **\u201cHow It Ended\u201d** with a clear, factual sequence and a candid \u201cwhy\u201d that fits your voice.",

      "content": "## Multex II\n\nMultex II was a very different business than Multex I. Multex I was primarily a services business. The service work kept the lights on and provided a living for me and my employees. But from the beginning I was dreaming about building products. I simply didn\u2019t know, at that time, that there was another viable way to build a company besides funding it through services and revenue.\n\nFrom my first meeting with Fred, I realized there was a different model\u2014provided you could get venture capitalists interested in supporting your efforts. At that first meeting, Fred made it sound easy. I was just starting to learn.\n\nRealistically, raising venture money is its own story. By the time Multex went public, I had a real education in what it means to build a VC-based business. Over the years we raised more than $50 million across five or six rounds\u2014A through F, if I remember correctly\u2014and I pitched to and dealt with a substantial number of VCs.\n\nStill, I don\u2019t want this chapter to overemphasize the VC angle. I want it to be about my experience building a product-based business, and the education I received in the process\u2014about being a businessman, a leader, an entrepreneur, and all of the above. Along the way, I was also learning about life in America\u2014New York\u2019s version of it, to be more precise.\n\nA lot of my early VC education was facilitated by Fred. He was learning the discipline himself, but he was very generous in sharing his knowledge and experience. Over time I learned to trust him and to rely on his advice and judgment. I\u2019ve known Fred now for close to 35 years\u2014almost the span of both our careers. Today he is a close friend and colleague, and of course a very successful and famous VC. But that\u2019s 35 years later.\n\n---\n\n### Series A: Euclid Partners\n\nAfter our first meeting, Fred introduced me to the firm and, more importantly, to Milton Pappas\u2014his senior partner and mentor. Over the years I got to know and appreciate Milton as well. He was from a different generation, almost my parents\u2019 generation, but along with Fred he helped me navigate the venture world.\n\nOur first round\u2014Series A, led by Euclid Partners with Fred\u2014was one of the most difficult, as it often is. Mody and I each committed to invest $100,000 in that round to demonstrate our personal dedication to the business. Euclid, after extensive due diligence, invested $1 million. So, if I remember correctly, the first round was either $1.2 million or $1 million total, with Mody and me contributing $200,000 and Euclid providing the rest.\n\nThat round started us on the path of building a VC-backed business. For me personally, it started a journey that would eventually lead to building and running one of the early Internet-based public companies.\n\nOne of the first things we did, once the initial financing was in the bank, was start looking for office space. Our ADP space\u2014and our contract with ADP\u2014was coming to an end.\n\nWe sublet space in the financial district, downtown Manhattan, which from that point forward became our favorite location for most of our New York offices for the next ten years. The address was **32 Maiden Lane**, right across from the Federal Reserve building. The office was fully furnished and had space for about 50 people. At that point we had just over 20 people in the company, and I was concerned we were renting far too much space.\n\nBut the price was very low, even by the standards of the time\u2014about $13 per square foot\u2014so Mody convinced me to take it. It turned out to be a very smart move. We filled the space, I think, in less than a year.\n\n---\n\n### Early Prototype: Multex Net\n\nLet me describe the first iteration of the product we built and took to market, and the competitive dynamic that began from the moment we appeared.\n\nSince the Internet was not yet a mainstream option, the most important part of building a networking product was building the network itself. The other major challenge was deciding on a portable document format that could be used to deliver research electronically.\n\nLuck is always an important ingredient in any successful business. Multex had two very lucky things happen without which we might not have succeeded. One was, obviously, the Internet becoming mainstream. The second was the announcement and eventual proliferation of **PDF** as a portable document format.\n\n---\n\n### Proprietary IP-Based Distributed Network Architecture\n\nWhen we built the first version of the product, it was a Windows/PC-based user interface that connected over a local network to an on-premises server. That server connected through a frame-relay based TCP/IP wide-area network to our central system. Our central system ran the central repository: a database that accumulated all the research documents contributed to us by research providers. Those providers, in turn, ran a server connected to a Windows/PC-based contribution application we also supplied.\n\nThe overall system had a two-tier star configuration\u2014a two-level graph. (See Figure 1, TBD.) We called this version **Multex Net**, because the proprietary network was arguably the most important part of the product.\n\nTechnically, it worked well. But it created real business and operational challenges.\n\nThe first was cost. In those days, wide-area connections were not cheap. On top of that, the cost of servers, routers, and other telecommunications equipment was substantial. Once built out\u2014and with enough customers\u2014it could become cost-effective and create a meaningful moat against competitors. But scaling it was expensive.\n\nThe second challenge was also related to scaling: building the support organization responsible for installation and ongoing support of equipment on customer premises.\n\nNevertheless, with Euclid Partners\u2019 initial investment we got the system off the ground and started installing early adopters on both sides: research providers and institutional investor clients of those firms.\n\nOf course, we also faced the classic \u201ctwo-sided network\u201d problem. We needed a critical mass of both providers and consumers for the system to be interesting and cost-effective to either side. And we had to convince both sides that we could achieve that critical mass.\n\nIn our case, competition became one of the most important forces that ultimately helped us succeed.\n\n---\n\n### First Call: The Incumbent Monopoly\n\nAt that time there was only one company in the market offering something even somewhat similar to what we were attempting to do. The company was called **First Call**, part of **Thomson Financial**.\n\nTheir technology was inferior and limited. They delivered only a subset of research\u2014\u201cmorning notes\u201d\u2014in a textual format through a broadcast system. It was essentially a broadcast of text snippets that research organizations contributed each morning. Once delivered, the information could not be changed, and there was no meaningful historical review. The morning notes were only a small subset of the research produced by those firms.\n\nBut First Call was unique in offering any electronic stream of research at all. It was, in essence, a research newswire. And because it was a monopoly, it benefited enormously. It charged both contributors and consumers very high prices for access. Both sides\u2014powerful financial institutions\u2014hated being beholden to a company that acted like an arrogant monopoly.\n\nThat\u2019s why, when we appeared on the horizon, many of those firms were interested in making sure we could succeed. The market desperately wanted a legitimate competitor to First Call.\n\nOur entrance was generally cheered and supported by both sides: investment banks and brokerages (the producers of research, the sell-side) and investment management firms (the consumers of research, the buy-side).\n\nThis dynamic helped us throughout our existence. The market viewed us as technologically advanced, nimble, and flexible\u2014the \u201cgood guys\u201d\u2014and First Call as retrograde and inflexible\u2014the \u201cbad guys.\u201d\n\nStill, competing against a large, financially powerful incumbent was never easy. At times they came close to killing us. One of the most interesting moments started about two years into our existence.\n\n---\n\n### Adobe and the Announcement of PDF\n\nWe first encountered First Call directly at the Adobe announcement of PDF. It was the summer of 1993, in New York, in one of the big hotels.\n\nAt that point we already had an early version of Multex Net running\u2014at least strong enough to demonstrate. Jim somehow got us invited to present, along with Dr. **John Warnock**, Adobe\u2019s co-founder, as one of the early adopters of PDF technology.\n\nWe used an early beta version of the PDF reader inside our product.\n\nSitting in the audience, not far from me, was the CTO of First Call with a few of his colleagues. They paid close attention to our presentation, and it was clear they were concerned we might be encroaching on their turf.\n\nShortly after that we discovered First Call was working on a product that would provide functionality directly competitive to ours.\n\nAbout a year later, as we made early progress in the market, we already had several important contributors and users. These were big firms\u2014our early supporters and adopters. On the sell-side we had **Merrill Lynch** and **Goldman Sachs**. On the buy-side we had **T. Rowe Price**, **Prudential**, and others.\n\n---\n\n### Fidelity\u2019s Acquisition Offer\u2014Derailed\n\nFidelity Investments was very interested in our product as well. They were one of the more technologically advanced firms, and one of the most acquisitive in technology. They began to consider acquiring Multex.\n\nAt that point we had mostly used up the first round and were evaluating our next step. Fidelity\u2019s interest was timely and, for me personally, financially meaningful. They offered **$20 million** for the company and proposed to provide continuing funding and resources so we could keep building the product.\n\nGiven Fidelity\u2019s influence in the market, our most difficult task\u2014getting sell-side firms to contribute their research\u2014would become much less of an issue. With critical mass of content from the sell-side, the value of the product to the buy-side would increase dramatically.\n\nAlso, because we were still running on a proprietary network and needed significant funding to roll it out, Fidelity\u2019s financial backing was crucial.\n\nWe went through extensive due diligence. We met with senior management at Fidelity, including **Ned Johnson**, the CEO at the time. Everything looked good. In fact, we were just a day away from signing the definitive agreement.\n\nThat\u2019s when we received notification that First Call had started a patent case against us, claiming \u201cprior art\u201d in their technology versus ours.\n\nAs it eventually turned out, it was completely bogus. We clearly had prior art: First Call didn\u2019t even have a product when we were already publicly demonstrating ours. But the filing itself was enough to scare off Fidelity. The deal was never consummated.\n\nSuddenly we had almost no funds to continue development. We were very close to shutting the company down.\n\nFred and I immediately started contacting potential investors. One lifesaving factor at that point was that we had completed a deal with **Bloomberg Financial** to become a redistributor of our research database to their customers. We already had a similar deal signed with **Reuters**, and adding the other major market data vendor was important, even though financially neither deal materially contributed to revenue at that stage.\n\n---\n\n### Series B: AT&T Ventures\n\nWe eventually managed to pull together the next round. The main new investor was **AT&T Ventures**, and the partner who led the investment\u2014and became a board member\u2014was **Alessandro Piol**.\n\nI don\u2019t remember whether we had other new investors in that round beyond Euclid Partners continuing to participate. But once the round closed, we were able to continue operations.\n\n---\n\n### Subsequent Raises: Softbank and Chase Ventures\n\nOver the next year or two, we raised additional capital from **Softbank** and **Chase Ventures**.\n\nSoftbank is, of course, a famous investment house, but at the time it was much smaller. They were represented by **Charley Lax**, who joined our board. Even though Multex wasn\u2019t one of their famous mega-investments, as one of their portfolio companies I met several partners and executives, including the famous **Masayoshi Son**. That happened much later, after we were already public, when I was in Japan for the opening of **Multex Investor Japan**, a joint venture with Reuters.\n\nChase Ventures was represented by **Bob Greene**, who also joined our board of directors.\n\nBy this point, the combined VCs held majority control of the equity in the company, so their influence on the business and technical direction became very important.\n\n---\n\n### Diverging Views: The Internet Debate\n\nOne key event I remember from that period\u2014sometime in the middle of 1995\u2014was a discussion that became more like a heated debate at a board meeting.\n\nThe first version of our product had been built around 1993, when the Internet and the browser were not yet as commonplace as they would soon become. Even though we used a TCP/IP network, the system relied on a proprietary frame-relay network, which guaranteed delivery and throughput but was very expensive. To build it out we needed substantial investment.\n\nBy then, excitement around the Internet was reaching a very high level, as often happens when a new technology trend takes off. VCs tend to be the first to get excited. My investors were advocating very aggressively that we migrate to Internet delivery instead of continuing with a proprietary private network.\n\nEven though I was equally excited about what the Internet could become, I also recognized the practical limitations at that time. Most connections were dial-up. Corporate clients were reluctant and cautious about adopting what they viewed as an insecure and very slow Internet. And given the primitive capabilities of early browsers, I believed our chances of delivering a robust, information-heavy product over the Internet were slim.\n\nThe investors were adamant\u2014so adamant that they intimated that if I wouldn\u2019t agree, they would fire me as CEO.\n\nThe debate went back and forth for months. Eventually we settled on a compromise: we would implement an Internet/browser-based version of the product, but continue to offer both options\u2014a dedicated network and an Internet version.\n\nWe operated that way for a while, but the speed of Internet adoption surprised all of us. Before long, the only version of the product we offered was the Internet/browser-based version.\n\nAt the same time, we had a group of users who loved the dynamic interface of the older version. We ended up migrating that proprietary interface to the Internet so we could offer an Internet-connected version with an active desktop front end. Today this type of approach is common\u2014many applications have both a browser version and a native desktop app. At the time, it proved to be forward-looking.\n\nThe Internet changed almost everything for us.\n\nFirst, it changed the **cost structure**. Instead of paying for infrastructure and operations on a proprietary network, many of those costs effectively disappeared. If clients had a decent Internet connection, all they had to do to access our service was point their browser to our URL.\n\nSecond, it reduced our **support and operational burden**. We no longer had to install and support as much equipment on client premises, and the complexity on our side dropped dramatically.\n\nThird, it changed **market perception**. The excitement around the Internet and the opportunities it represented reached such a peak that any company considered an \u201cInternet company\u201d\u2014especially with a \u201c.com\u201d in the name\u2014became golden.\n\n---\n\n### The Internet Bubble\n\nSuddenly, young Internet companies began to go public. Netscape IPO\u2019d on August 9, 1995, only a year after being founded. That was really the beginning of the Internet bubble.\n\nI don\u2019t think Netscape had meaningful revenue at that point. And after that, it often didn\u2019t matter whether a company had a reasonable business model or even a plan. Many companies that didn\u2019t deserve to be funded went public.\n\nNaturally, we were swept up in the excitement.\n\nBy 1998\u20131999 we had already established a solid name in the industry and reached revenue of approximately **$20 million**. We were not yet profitable, but we were growing at a good rate\u2014probably close to 100% annually. Compared to many so-called Internet companies at the time, we were a reasonable candidate for an IPO within a year or two.\n\nBut because of the excitement\u2014and pressure from investors\u2014we decided to take advantage of momentum and go public while the market was hot. And it was super-hot.\n\n---\n\n### Building Up to the IPO\n\nBecause our market was what today would be called FinTech\u2014but at the time was considered a \u201cvertical\u201d market rather than a consumer market, which was more fashionable\u2014we were not viewed as the most favorable IPO candidate. Nevertheless, investment banks were eager to secure potential IPO targets and courted us aggressively.\n\nEventually we selected three firms to prepare us for an IPO, in order of priority:\n\n1. **Robertson Stephens**, a San Francisco-based specialty investment bank  \n2. **CIBC Oppenheimer**, a New York-based investment bank  \n3. **Dain Rauscher Wessels**, a Midwest-based investment bank  \n\nEven though I had been running the business for over four years by then and had raised significant VC capital, I was still na\u00efve about IPOs and what the process really demanded. Some of my VC investors suggested that I hire a private instructor to educate me and prepare me for the roadshow.\n\nIt turned out to be a very good and interesting experience. My coach was a woman in her sixties, and she smoked like a chimney. But she was excellent. She took me clothes shopping, worked with me on being comfortable in front of an audience, taught me how to make a concise, to-the-point presentation, and drilled me on many other skills that turned out to be essential for a CEO preparing to face public markets.\n\nOverall, I remember that preparation period with real fondness. It wasn\u2019t only about going public. It was part of my continuing education\u2014learning how to represent the company, the product, and the story in a way that investors, analysts, and the market could understand.",

      "content": "## Multex II\n\nMultex II was a very different business than Multex I. Multex I was primarily a service business. The service work was a means to provide a living for me and my employees. Even then, I was always dreaming about building products, but I didn\u2019t really know there were other options. I thought you either had enough revenue to fund your growth, or you didn\u2019t have a business.\n\nFrom my first meeting with Fred, I realized there was another path\u2014if you could get venture capitalists interested in supporting your efforts. At that first meeting, Fred made it sound easy. I was just starting to learn what \u201ceasy\u201d really meant.\n\nThe truth is, raising VC money is its own story. By the time Multex went public, I had a real education in what it means to build a VC-backed company. Eventually we raised more than $50 million in five or six rounds\u2014A through F, if I remember correctly\u2014and I pitched to, negotiated with, and answered to a substantial number of investors.\n\nStill, I don\u2019t want this chapter to overdo the venture-capital angle. I want it to be about my experience building a product business and the education I received in the process\u2014about leadership, decision-making, markets, and what it means to be a businessman and an entrepreneur. Along the way I was also learning about life in America\u2014New York\u2019s version of it, to be more precise.\n\nMost of my early VC education was facilitated by Fred. He was learning the discipline himself, but he was generous in sharing what he knew and what he was learning. Over time, I learned to trust him and rely on his advice and judgment. I have known Fred now for almost 35 years\u2014nearly the span of both our careers. Today he is a close friend and colleague, and a very successful and well-known VC. But that\u2019s decades later. Back then, he was the person helping me understand a world I didn\u2019t yet speak fluently.\n\n### Series A: Euclid Partners\n\nAfter our first meeting, Fred introduced me to the rest of the firm and, more importantly, to Milton Pappas, his senior partner and mentor. Milton was from a different generation\u2014almost my parents\u2019 generation\u2014but I came to know and appreciate him. In his own way, he helped me learn how VCs think and how to survive in their ecosystem.\n\nOur Series A round, led by Euclid Partners with Fred, was one of the hardest\u2014like most first rounds. Mody and I each committed $100,000 to show personal dedication. Euclid, after extensive due diligence, invested about $1 million. If I remember correctly, the round totaled roughly $1.2 million, with $200,000 from Mody and me and Euclid covering the rest.\n\nThat money started Multex on the path to becoming a VC-backed product company. It also started me on a personal journey toward building and running what would become one of the early Internet-based public companies.\n\nOnce the initial financing was in our bank account, one of the first things we did was look for space. Our arrangement with ADP was coming to an end, and our contract with them was expiring. We needed an office we controlled.\n\nWe sublet space in the financial district of lower Manhattan, downtown\u2014a location that would become our favorite for much of the next decade. The address was 32 Maiden Lane, directly across from the Federal Reserve. The office was fully furnished and had room for about 50 people. At the time we had just over 20, and my first reaction was worry. It felt like far too much space for a company still learning to walk.\n\nBut the rent was remarkably low\u2014about $13 per square foot\u2014and Mody convinced me to take it. In less than a year, we filled the space. That decision was an early reminder that a product company has to think ahead of its current footprint.\n\n### Multex Net: Building the Network Before the Internet\n\nThe first iteration of our product was built at a time when the Internet was not yet a practical delivery platform for business-critical systems. In those days, if you were building a networking product, you often had to build the network itself. Another major challenge was choosing a portable document format that could support the electronic delivery of research.\n\nLuck is always part of any successful business. Multex had two lucky breaks without which we might not have succeeded. The first was the Internet becoming mainstream. The second was the announcement\u2014and eventual proliferation\u2014of PDF as a portable document format.\n\nBefore either force fully reshaped the world, we built what we called Multex Net. The \u201cNet\u201d was not a marketing flourish. The proprietary network was arguably the most important part of the product.\n\n### A Proprietary, IP-Based Distributed Network Architecture\n\nWe built Multex Net as a Windows/PC-based user interface that connected over a local network to a server running on the client\u2019s premises. That server connected through a frame-relay based TCP/IP wide-area network to our central system. Our central system ran the central repository\u2014a database that accumulated all the research documents contributed to us by research providers. Those providers, in turn, ran a server connected to a Windows/PC-based contribution application we supplied.\n\nThe whole system had a two-tier star configuration, essentially a two-level graph. (See Figure 1, TBD.) Technically, it worked. But it created serious business and operational challenges.\n\nThe first was cost. Wide-area connections were not cheap, and neither was the hardware\u2014servers, routers, and telecommunications equipment. In theory, if you built enough scale, it could become cost-effective and form a moat. In practice, scaling the build-out required significant capital.\n\nThe second challenge was support. To install and maintain equipment at client sites, you need an organization built for deployment and field support. That kind of operational burden can grow quickly and become a limiting factor.\n\nStill, with Euclid\u2019s initial investment, we got the system off the ground and started installing early adopter clients\u2014both research providers and institutional investors.\n\nWe also faced a classic two-sided-market problem: the system needed a critical mass of both providers and consumers to be valuable to either side. And we had to convince both sides that we could reach that critical mass.\n\nIn our case, one of the most important forces that helped us get there was the presence of a competitor.\n\n### First Call: The Monopoly the Market Resented\n\nAt the time, there was only one company offering something even somewhat similar to what we were trying to build: First Call, part of Thomson Financial.\n\nTheir technology was inferior and limited. They delivered only a small subset of research\u2014\u201cmorning notes\u201d\u2014in text format through a broadcast system. It was essentially a broadcast of the snippets that research organizations submitted in the morning. Once delivered, that information could not be changed, and there was no meaningful historical review. And of course, morning notes were only a small fraction of what research departments actually produced.\n\nBut First Call had one crucial advantage: it was unique. It offered an electronic stream of research, effectively a research newswire, and it enjoyed the benefits of monopoly status. It charged both contributors and consumers very high prices, and both sides\u2014powerful financial institutions\u2014resented being beholden to a company that behaved like an arrogant monopoly.\n\nThat\u2019s why, when we appeared, many firms didn\u2019t just show interest\u2014they wanted us to succeed. The market wanted a legitimate competitor.\n\nOur arrival was generally welcomed by investment banks and brokerages (the producers of research, the sell-side) and by investment management firms (the consumers of research, the buy-side). Throughout our existence, that dynamic helped us. The market tended to see us as technologically advanced, nimble, and flexible\u2014the \u201cgood guys\u201d\u2014and First Call as retrograde and inflexible\u2014the \u201cbad guys.\u201d\n\nOf course, competing against a large, well-funded incumbent was never easy. At times they nearly killed us. One of the most memorable sequences started in the summer of 1993.\n\n### Adobe and the Announcement of PDF\n\nWe first ran into First Call directly at Adobe\u2019s announcement of PDF. It was the summer of 1993, in New York, in one of the big hotels.\n\nBy then we had an early version of Multex Net running\u2014at least enough to demonstrate capabilities. Jim somehow got us invited to present, along with Dr. John Warnock, Adobe\u2019s co-founder, as an early adopter of PDF technology. We used an early beta version of the PDF reader in our product.\n\nSitting in the audience, not far from me, was the CTO of First Call with several colleagues. They watched our presentation closely, and it was obvious they were concerned that we might be moving into their territory.\n\nShortly after that, we discovered First Call was working on a product that would be directly competitive with ours.\n\nAbout a year later, we had made early progress in the market. We had contributors and users, and they were not small names. On the sell-side we had Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs. On the buy-side we had T. Rowe Price, Prudential, and others. These firms became early supporters and early adopters, and their support mattered.\n\n### Fidelity\u2019s Acquisition Offer\u2014And How It Collapsed\n\nFidelity Investments became interested in our product as well. Fidelity was technologically advanced and, in that era, one of the most acquisitive firms in technology. They began to consider acquiring Multex.\n\nAt that point we had largely used up our first investment round and were thinking about what our next move should be. Fidelity\u2019s interest was timely, and for me personally it was significant. They offered $20 million for the company, along with continued funding and resources to develop the product.\n\nThe strategic logic was obvious. With Fidelity\u2019s influence, our hardest task\u2014getting the sell-side firms to contribute research\u2014would become much easier. With enough content contributed by the sell-side, the value to the buy-side would increase dramatically. And because we were still operating on a proprietary network and needed major funding to roll it out, Fidelity\u2019s financial backing could change the trajectory of the company.\n\nWe went through extensive due diligence. We met with senior management at Fidelity, including Ned Johnson, the CEO at the time. Everything seemed aligned. In fact, we were one day away from signing the definitive agreement.\n\nThen we received notification that First Call had filed a patent case against us, claiming \u201cprior art\u201d in their technology versus ours.\n\nAs it eventually turned out, it was bogus. We clearly had prior art: First Call didn\u2019t even have a comparable product when we were already publicly demonstrating ours. But the filing itself was enough to create risk and uncertainty. Fidelity backed away. The deal was never consummated.\n\nAnd suddenly we were nearly out of money.\n\nWe came very close to shutting the company down.\n\nFred and I began working the phones, contacting potential investors as quickly as we could. One factor that helped us survive that period was a deal we had completed with Bloomberg Financial to become a redistributor of our research database to their customers. We already had a similar deal signed with Reuters. Adding Bloomberg mattered strategically, even though neither relationship materially changed our revenue at that stage.\n\n### Series B: AT&T Ventures\n\nWe ultimately managed to pull together the next round. The main new investor was AT&T Ventures, and the partner who led the investment\u2014and became a board member\u2014was Alessandro Piol. I don\u2019t remember whether we had other new investors outside of Euclid continuing to invest, but once the round closed we were able to keep operating and continue building.\n\n### Subsequent Rounds: Softbank and Chase Ventures\n\nOver the next year or two we raised additional capital from Softbank and Chase Ventures.\n\nSoftbank is a famous name now, but at that time it was much smaller. It was represented by Charley Lax, who joined our board. Even though Multex wasn\u2019t one of Softbank\u2019s famous mega-investments, being in their portfolio gave me access to their world. I met several partners and executives, including Masayoshi Son\u2014although that happened much later, after we were already a public company, when I traveled to Japan for the opening of Multex Investor Japan, a joint venture with Reuters.\n\nChase Ventures was represented by Bob Greene, who also joined our board.\n\nBy this point, the combined VCs held a majority of the company\u2019s equity. That changed the center of gravity in decision-making. Their influence on business and technical direction was no longer advisory\u2014it was structural.\n\n### When the Board Wanted the Internet\u2014and I Wasn\u2019t Sure\n\nOne event from that time stands out vividly. Sometime in the middle of 1995, we had a board discussion that turned into a heated debate.\n\nOur first product architecture had been designed in 1993, when the Internet and the browser were not yet commonplace. Even though the system used TCP/IP, it relied on a proprietary frame-relay network. That network delivered guaranteed throughput and reliability, but it was expensive. To scale it, we would need more capital.\n\nMeanwhile, Internet excitement was rising fast. As usual, VCs were among the first to become intensely enthusiastic. They advocated aggressively that we move to Internet delivery and stop investing in a proprietary private network.\n\nI shared the excitement about the promise of the Internet, but I was worried about the reality. Dial-up speeds were slow. Corporate security teams were cautious. And browsers were primitive. I believed it would be difficult to deliver a robust, information-heavy product reliably over the Internet, and I didn\u2019t want to damage the trust we had earned from early clients.\n\nThe investors pushed hard\u2014hard enough that the message was clear: if I refused, they could replace me as CEO.\n\nThe debate went back and forth over months. Eventually we reached a compromise. We would implement an Internet/browser-based version of the product, but we would continue to offer clients both a dedicated network and an Internet version.\n\nFor a while, that hybrid approach worked. Then the Internet adoption curve shocked us. Before long, the browser-based version became the only version we sold.\n\nAt the same time, we had users who loved the dynamic interface of the older software. We ended up migrating that proprietary interface to work over the Internet so we could offer an Internet-connected version with an active desktop front end. Today, this combination\u2014browser version plus a \u201cnative\u201d desktop application\u2014is common. At the time, it was early.\n\nThe Internet changed everything for us: cost, support, market perception, and our ability to become a public company.\n\nInstead of paying for proprietary infrastructure and operations, many of those costs effectively disappeared. If clients had decent Internet access, all they had to do was point their browsers to our URL. Our operational burden dropped dramatically as well; we no longer had to install and support the same level of equipment on customer premises.\n\nAnd then there was the perception shift. The Internet became the story. Being labeled an \u201cInternet company\u201d changed how customers, investors, and banks looked at you.\n\n### The Internet Bubble\n\nYoung Internet companies began going public at a pace that quickly became irrational. Netscape IPO\u2019d on August 9, 1995, just a year after being founded. That was the beginning of what became the Internet bubble.\n\nAt that time it often didn\u2019t matter whether a company had meaningful revenue, or even a realistic plan. If it had \u201c.com\u201d in its name, it could attract capital and public-market attention. Many companies that shouldn\u2019t have been funded went public.\n\nNaturally, we were swept up in that wave too.\n\nBy 1998\u20131999 we had established meaningful name recognition in the industry and reached approximately $20 million in revenue. We were not yet profitable, but we were growing rapidly\u2014close to 100% annually. Compared to many so-called Internet companies at the time, we looked like a serious candidate for an IPO within a year or two.\n\nBut the market was not just hot\u2014it was super-hot. With investor pressure and momentum behind us, we decided to go public while the window was wide open.\n\n### Building Up to the IPO\n\nBecause our market was what today would be called FinTech\u2014but at that time was described as a \u201cvertical\u201d market, not a consumer story\u2014we were not seen as the most fashionable IPO candidate. Still, investment banks were eager to win mandates, and they courted us aggressively.\n\nEventually we selected three firms to prepare us for an IPO, in this order:\n1. Robertson Stephens, a San Francisco-based specialty investment bank  \n2. CIBC Oppenheimer, a New York-based investment bank  \n3. Dain Rauscher Wessels, a Midwest-based investment bank  \n\nEven though I had run the business for more than four years and raised substantial venture capital by then, I was still na\u00efve about IPOs and what the process demanded. One of my VC investors suggested hiring a private coach to prepare me for the roadshow.\n\nIt turned out to be a good decision.\n\nMy coach was a woman in her sixties who smoked like a chimney. She was tough and practical, and she knew exactly what the public markets expected. She took me clothes shopping. She worked with me on presence and comfort in front of an audience. She pushed me to be concise and direct, and she taught me how to present a story that was both credible and compelling.\n\nI remember that preparation period with genuine fondness. It was not just training for an IPO roadshow. It was part of my education in what it meant to lead a company at a higher level\u2014where the story, the numbers, the strategy, and the person delivering them all had to align.",
